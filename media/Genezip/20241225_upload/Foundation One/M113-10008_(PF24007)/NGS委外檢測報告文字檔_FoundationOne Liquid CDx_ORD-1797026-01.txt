Diagnosis: Lung adenocarcinoma
MP No.: 39248210
Sample Type: Blood
Date of collection: 09 January 2024
NGS QC parameters: DNA input mass of 30ng for Library Construction.

Analytic Interpretation: Substitutions and insertion and deletion alterations (indels) are reported in 311
genes, copy number alterations (CNAs) are reported in 310 genes, and gene rearrangements are reported
in 324 genes. The test also detects the genomic signatures blood tumor mutational burden (bTMB),
microsatellite instability (MSI), and tumor fraction. FoundationOne Liquid CDx utilizes circulating
cell-free DNA (cfDNA) isolated from plasma derived from the anti-coagulated peripheral whole blood of
cancer patients

Analytical sensitivity : The estimated LoD for short variants is 0.40% for the enhanced sensitivity region and 0.82% of the standard sensitivity region. 
The median LoD is 30.4% tumor fraction for copy number losses.


Methodology: NovaSeq 6000 platform

Procedure: The assay employs a single DNA extraction method to obtain cfDNA from plasma from whole blood. Extracted
cfDNA undergoes whole-genome shotgun library construction and hybridization-based capture of
324 cancer-related genes including coding exons and select introns of 309 genes, as well as only
select intronic regions or non-coding regions of 15 genes. Hybrid-capture selected libraries are
sequenced with deep coverage using the NovaSeq 6000 platform. Sequence data are processed using
a customized analysis pipeline designed to accurately detect genomic alterations, including
base substitutions, indels, select copy number variants, and select genomic rearrangements.
Substitutions and insertion and deletion alterations (indels) are reported in 311 genes, copy number
alterations (CNAs) are reported in 310 genes, and gene rearrangements are reported in 324 genes.
