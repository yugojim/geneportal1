It also has a direct role in initiation of replication and the maintenance of genomic stability (M\u00f6r\u00f6y and Geisen, 2004; 15147722). Amplification of chromosomal region 19q12_q13 has been demonstrated in many types of cancer, and CCNE1 is a well_studied gene within this amplicon (Leung et al., 2006; 16575401, Lin et al., 2000; 11156406). Increased copy number of CCNE1 is highly associated with overexpression of the cyclin E1 protein (Mayr et al., 2006; 16753589, Nakayama et al., 2010; 20336784). Cyclin E1 overexpression can lead to cell transformation as a result of an increase in cyclin E1 activity (Stamatakos et al., 2010; 21176227, M\u00f6r\u00f6y and Geisen, 2004; 15147722). CCNE1 amplification was detected in 2.3% (1/43) of small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) cases analyzed in one study (Helsten et al., 2016; 27196769). In one study of lung neuroendocrine tumors, including small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, cyclin E was overexpressed in 21% (4/19) large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma samples and 71% (25/35) of SCLC samples (Salon et al., 2007; 17471231). A meta_analysis reports that cyclin E overexpression is correlated with poor prognosis in lung cancers (Huang et al., 2012; 22244930). There are no approved therapies that directly target CCNE1 alterations. Because amplification or overexpression of CCNE1 leads to increased genomic instability though the ATR_CHK1_WEE1 pathway (Lin et al., 2017; 28331049, Chen et al., 2018; 30181387) and cyclin E1 promotes cell cycle progression in a complex with CDK2 (M\u00f6r\u00f6y and Geisen, 2004; 15147722), clinical and preclinical studies have investigated inhibitors of ATR, CDK2, CHK1, HDAC, PKMYT1, and WEE1 as potential therapeutic approaches for tumors with CCNE1 activation. Clinical benefit has been reported for patients with recurrent high_grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) with CCNE1 amplification or expression in response to treatment with the CHK1 inhibitor prexasertib (Lee et al., 2018; 29361470). Studies of the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib observed PRs in patients with CCNE1_amplified HGSOC and ovarian cancer (Lheureux et al., 2021; 33485453, Oza et al., 2020; 32611648, Fu et al., 2023; 36469840). Similarly, in a Phase 2 study of patients with CCNE1_amplified solid tumors, adavosertib elicited an ORR of 27% with PRs reported for patients with ovarian cancer, urothelial carcinoma, or melanoma; median PFS was 4.1 months and median OS was 9.9 months (Fu et al., 2021; AACR abstract 974, Fu et al., 2023; 36469840). One study has reported a reduction in tumor CCNE1 levels in 4/6 lung and esophageal cancer cases following treatment with the HDAC inhibitor vorinostat (Ma et al., 2013; 23686769). Preclinical studies have demonstrated that cell lines and murine models with CCNE1 amplification or overexpression were sensitive to inhibitors of ATR (Toledo et al., 2011; 21552262, Buisson et al., 2015; 26365377), CDK2 (Yang et al., 2015; 26204491), PKMYT1 (Gallo et al., 2022; 35444283, Szychowski et al., 2022; 35880755), or WEE1 (Kok et al., 2020; 33028815, Chen et al., 2018; 30181387). However, other studies have shown that sensitivity of various cell lines to CDK2 inhibitors, including SNS_032, dinaciclib, and seliciclib, at clinically achievable doses, is largely independent of CCNE1 copy number or expression (Taylor_Harding et al., 2015; 25557169, Etemadmoghadam et al., 2013; 24004674, Scaltriti et al., 2011; 21321214, Nanos_Webb et al., 2012; 21695458).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Strong preclinical and clinical data suggest that CCNE1 amplification may predict sensitivity to WEE1 inhibitors.

In response to signals from the environment, EGFR passes biochemical messages to the cell that stimulate it to grow and divide (Ciardiello and Tortora, 2008; 18337605). EGFR exon 19 deletion mutations, such as seen here, have been shown to activate the tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR and to confer sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as erlotinib, gefitinib (Lynch et al., 2004; 15118073, Paez et al., 2004; 15118125, Pao et al., 2004; 15329413), afatinib (Yang et al., 2015; 25589191), osimertinib (Soria et al., 2018; 29151359), and dacomitinib (Wu et al., 2017; 28958502, Mok et al., 2018; 29864379), although limited preclinical data suggest reduced sensitivity to lapatinib (Gilmer et al., 2008; 18199554, Foster et al., 2016; 26996308). Activating mutations in EGFR have been reported in 3_5% of small cell lung cancers in the scientific literature (Lu et al., 2012; 22103903, Shiao et al., 2011; 21178714, Tatematsu et al., 2008; 18829487). Transformation to SCLC or large_cell neuroendocrine carcinoma has been observed as mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors in 3_14% of patients with advanced EGFR_mutated non_small cell lung cancer (Sequist et al., 2011; 21430269, Yu et al., 2013; 23470965, Niederst et al., 2015; 25758528, Marcoux et al., 2019; 30550363). In a retrospective multi_center study, patients with EGFR_mutated non_small cell lung cancer transformed to small cell lung cancer under EGFR inhibitor therapy experienced high response rates on platinum_etoposide (54% [25/46] ORR, 3.4 median PFS) or taxane (50% [10/20] ORR, 2.7 months median PFS) chemotherapy and a median OS of 10.9 months post_transformation; however, none of the included patients benefitted from treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (0/17 ORR) (Marcoux et al., 2019; 30550363). For patients with non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), EGFR activating mutations may predict sensitivity to EGFR\u2013TKIs, including erlotinib (Rosell et al., 2011; 22285168), gefitinib (Douillard et al., 2014; 24263064, Hayashi et al., 2020; 32673682, Cao et al., 2018; 29780256, Yang et al., 2011; 21422421), afatinib (Sequist et al., 2013; 23816960, Bao_Dong Qin et al., 2018; 30127622, Frega et al., 2016; 27131295, Long et al., 2020; 33116645), dacomitinib (Mok et al., 2018; 29864379), and osimertinib (Janne et al., 2015; 25923549, Bao_Dong Qin et al., 2018; 30127622); however, the data for patients with other tumor types are limited (Hong et al., 2020; 32749686, Kim et al., 2015; 26462025, Kim et al., 2015; 25424851, Mondal et al., 2020; 32303840, Cavalieri et al., 2018; 29734047, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886, Audet et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 6041). Transformation of EGFR_mutated non_small cell lung cancer to small cell lung cancer (SCLC) or large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) has been reported to be a mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors (Marcoux et al., 2018; 30550363, Oser et al., 2015; 25846096, Sequist et al., 2011; 21430269). Case studies have reported 2 patients with SCLC (Batra et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1016/j.jtocrr.2020.100098, Hirakawa et al., 2018; 30603652) and 1 patient with LCNEC (Ricordel et al., 2017; 29074211) with EGFR mutations who benefited from treatment with osimertinib; however, lack of benefit from osimertinib has been reported for 8 patients with EGFR_mutated SCLC (Minari et al., 2018; 29290257, Ham et al., 2016; 26762749, Moriguchi et al., 2019; 30828454) and 3 patients with EGFR_mutated LCNEC (Wang et al., 2019; 31371992, Miyazaki et al., 2020; 32762742, Baglivo et al., 2017; 28778263). In retrospective analyses, patients with EGFR_mutated non_small cell lung cancer that transformed to small cell lung cancer demonstrated response rates of 50% to taxane and 54% (with a median PFS of 3.4 months) to platinum_etoposide (Dingemans et al., 2021; 33864941, Marcoux et al., 2019; 30550363).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "EGFR activating mutations, rearrangements, or amplification may predict sensitivity to EGFR_targeted therapies.

The PI3K pathway is involved in cell signaling that regulates a number of critical cellular functions, including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, motility, and survival (Samuels et al., 2005; 15950905, Engelman, 2009; 19629070). PIK3CA alterations that have been characterized as activating, such as observed here, are predicted to be oncogenic (Kang et al., 2005; 15647370, Ikenoue et al., 2005; 15930273, Gymnopoulos et al., 2007; 17376864, Horn et al., 2008; 18317450, Rudd et al., 2011; 21266528, Hon et al., 2012; 22120714, Burke et al., 2012; 22949682, Wu et al., 2009; 19915146, Dbouk et al., 2010; 2103068, Dan et al., 2010; 20530683, Oda et al., 2008; 18829572, Zhao and Vogt, 2008; 18794883, Lui et al., 2013; 23619167, Ross et al., 2013; 22430209, Riviere et al., 2012; 22729224, Shibata et al., 2009; 19394761, Droguluk et al., 2015; 26627007, Croessmann et al., 2018; 29284706, Ng et al., 2018; 29533785, Spangle et al., 2020; 32929011, Chen et al., 2018; 29636477, Jin et al., 2021; 34779417). PIK3CA mutation and amplification have each been reported in 3% of small cell lung carcinomas (SCLC)(Ross et al., 2014; 24978188). p110_alpha has been reported to be overexpressed in 25% of small cell lung carcinomas as compared to normal lung tissue (Wojtalla et al., 2013; 23172887). The prognostic significance of PIK3CA alteration in SCLC has not been extensively studied (PubMed, Aug 2022). Clinical and preclinical data in various tumor types indicate that PIK3CA activating alterations may predict sensitivity to therapies targeting PI3K (Fritsch et al., 2014; 24608574, Juric et al., 2018; 29401002, Gallant et al., 2019; 30793038, Canaud et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract LBA23, Delestre et al., 2021; 34613809, Morschhauser et al., 2020; 31619463, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108, Santin et al., 2020; 31934607, Damodaran et al., 2022; 35133871), AKT (Andre et al., 2019; 31091374, Smyth et al., 2021; 33863913), or mTOR (Varnier et al., 2019; 31351267, Basse et al., 2018; 32914004, Sultova et al., 2021; 33277683, Mackay et al., 2014; 24166148, Myers et al., 2016; 27016228, Dhami et al., 2018; 29588307, Harris et al., 2019; 30863722, Hanna et al., 2018; 29301825). The Phase 2 NCI_MATCH study of copanlisib for patients with refractory solid tumors harboring PIK3CA mutations with or without PTEN loss met its primary endpoint with an ORR of 16% (4/25 PRs); responses (PR or SD >6 months) were seen in patients with ameloblastoma, liposarcoma, and carcinomas of the endometrium, ovary, esophagus, lung, and prostate (Damodaran et al., 2022; 35133871). However, the Phase 2 study of copanlisib for patients with endometrial carcinoma harboring PIK3CA hotspot mutations failed to report any objective responses (n=11)(Santin et al., 2020; 31934607). Two other studies of copanlisib for patients with genomically unselected tumors reported 1 CR and 2 PRs (1 unconfirmed) among 16 total patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors with or without PTEN alterations (Morschhauser et al., 2020; 31619463, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108). In the Phase 2 MATCH trial for patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors, 28% (18/65) of patients experienced PFS lasting at least 6 months after treatment with taselisib; however, no ORs were observed in this study (Krop et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 101). A separate Phase 1b study of taselisib in combination with the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib for patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors reported an ORR of 0% (n=12) and a DCR of 17% (2/12) (Pascual et al., 2021; 32958578). In a Phase 1 trial of the dual PI3K/mTOR kinase inhibitor apitolisib, 79% (11/14) of patients with PIK3CA_mutated advanced solid tumors experienced disease control (3 PRs, 8 SDs) (Dolly et al., 2016; 26787751). The PI3K inhibitor alpelisib is approved as a single agent for the treatment of patients with PIK3CA_related overgrowth spectrum (PROS) (Canaud et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract LBA23), but has shown limited activity as monotherapy for PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors with a Phase 1a study reporting an ORR of 6.0% (8/134) and a DCR of 58% (78/134) (Juric et al., 2018; 29401002).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "PIK3CA activating mutations may lead to activation of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway and may therefore indicate sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway.

Alterations such as seen here may disrupt RB1 function or expression (Berge et al., 2010; 20594292, Giacinti et al., 2006; 16936740, Otterson et al., 1997; 9342358, Otterson et al., 1999; 10486322, Qin et al., 1992; 1534305, Rubin et al., 2005; 16360038, Sun et al., 2006; 16449662). RB1 mutation has been observed in 33_74% of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cases (cBio_Rudin et al., 2012; 22941189, cBio_George et al., 2015; 26168399, cBio_Peifer et al., 2012; 22941188). Inactivation of RB1 and subsequent loss of Rb protein expression is a hallmark molecular event in SCLC, cited in more than 90% of cases in some studies (Peifer et al., 2012; 22941188, Burkhart and Sage, 2008; 18650841, Kitamura et al., 2009; 19390995). In SCLC, RB wild_type status has been reported to be associated with worse OS and PFS and an increased chemo_refractory tumor response (Bhateja et al., 2019; 30773851; McColl et al., 2017; 29088741). In a retrospective multi_center study, patients with EGFR_mutated non_small cell lung cancer transformed to small cell lung cancer under EGFR inhibitor therapy experienced high response rates on platinum_etoposide (54% [25/46] ORR, 3.4 median PFS) or taxane (50% [10/20] ORR, 2.7 months median PFS) chemotherapy and a median OS of 10.9 months post_transformation; however, none of the included patients benefitted from treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (0/17 ORR) (Marcoux et al., 2019; 30550363). Inactivation of both Rb and p53 in a mouse model led to the development of SCLC tumors, supporting the suggestion that Rb loss is critically involved in SCLC development (Meuwissen et al., 2003; 14522252). On the basis of limited clinical data (Owonikoko et al., 2016; ESMO Abstract 14230) and strong preclinical data (Hook et al., 2012; 22222631, Gong et al., 2019; 30373917, Oser et al., 2019; 30373918, Yang et al., 2022; 34741392), RB1 inactivation may be associated with sensitivity to inhibitors of Aurora kinase A, particularly in small cell lung cancer (SCLC). A clinical study evaluating the Aurora kinase A inhibitor alisertib for patients with prostate cancer did not find an association between RB1 deletion and clinical benefit (Beltran et al., 2019; 30232224). Other approaches to target RB1 inactivation under investigation in preclinical studies include inhibitors of BCL_2 family members (Allaman_Pillet et al., 2013; 21955141) and activation of the NOTCH pathway (Viatour et al., 2011; 21875955). Mutations in TP53 or RB1 are characteristic of poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) and may help distinguish NECs from well differentiated or unclearly differentiated tumors (NCCN Neuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors, v2.2022) (Pavel et al., 2020; 32272208, Baudin et al., 2021; 33482246, Rindi et al., 2018; 30140036, Nagtegaal et al., 2020; 31433515, Konukiewitz et al., 2017; 28059098). Mutations in RB1 underlie the development of retinoblastoma (RB), a rare tumor that arises at a rate of approximately 1:20,000 live births, with nearly 5,000 new cases worldwide per year (Chen et al., 2014; 24282159). Germline mutations in RB1 account for approximately 40% of RB tumors (Yun et al., 2011; 22553621) and are associated with an increased risk of developing secondary malignancies that include soft tissue and bone sarcoma and malignant melanoma (Houston et al., 2011; 21139478, Ng et al., 2010; 19959033).

FGF10 has been implicated in regulating the epithelial_mesenchymal transition in cancer cells (Abolhassani et al., 2014; 25057305) and during normal development (Volckaert and De Langhe, 2014; 24891877). Germline mutations in FGF10 have been implicated in aplasia of the lacrimal and salivary glands, an autosomal dominant developmental disorder (Entesarian et al., 2005; 15654336). Amplification of FGF10 has been reported in cancer (Gao et al., 2013; 23550210) and may be biologically relevant in this context (Zack et al., 2013; 24071852, Beroukhim et al., 2010; 20164920). Infrequent but recurrent amplification of FGF10 has been reported in multiple solid tumor types, including gallbladder cancer (Javle et al., 2014; 24508317), gastric cancer (Ooi et al., 2015; 25743022), and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (Chattopadhyay et al., 2010; 20083228); one small_scale study reported FGF10 amplification in 7/7 oral SCC cases (Cha et al., 2011; 21334929). Preclinical studies have shown that increased FGF10 expression and FGF10_FGFR1/2 signaling promotes cancer cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and tumorigenesis in a variety of tumor models (Theodoru et al., 2004; 15208658, Memarzadeh et al., 2007; 18068633, Nomura et al., 2008; 18594526, Nakao et al., 2013; 24002438). A preclinical study reported that FGF10_driven migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer cell lines could be blocked by inhibitory antibodies targeting FGFR2 (Nomura et al., 2008; 18594526), and a second study found that expression of dominant_negative FGFR1 or FGFR2 led to a decrease in tumor size in a prostate cancer xenograft model driven by FGF10, although the decrease was not statistically significant (Memarzadeh et al., 2007; 18068633). Clinical trials are ongoing for multiple inhibitors that target FGFR2 and other kinases, including the approved agents pazopanib, ponatinib, and lenvatinib, as well as pan_FGFR inhibitors such as AZD4547, infigratinib, CH5183284, and TAS_120; however, these agents have not been comprehensively tested in the context of FGF10 amplification or overexpression.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "MS_Stable", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "MS_Stable"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSI_H is generally infrequent in NSCLC, reported in fewer than 1% of samples across several large studies (Warth et al., 2016; 26637197, Ninomiya et al., 2006; 16641899, Vanderwalde et al., 2018; 29436178, Zang et al., 2019; 31270941, Dudley et al., 2016; 26880610, Takamochi et al., 2017; 28676214, Schrock et al., 2017; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtho.2016.11.487), whereas data on the reported incidence of MSI_H in SCLC has been limited and conflicting (Pylkkanen et al., 1997; 9329646, Gonzalez et al., 2000; 11061602, Chen et al., 1996; 8782463, Merlo et al., 1994; 8174113). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of MSI in SCLC are limited (PubMed, Jun 2023). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "RICTOR", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "true", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "RICTOR encodes an mTOR_binding protein that forms part of the rapamycin_insensitive mTORC2 complex, a regulator of cell metabolism and the cytoskeleton (Sarbassov et al., 2004; 15268862, Jacinto et al., 2004; 15467718, Pearce et al., 2007; 17461779). RICTOR amplification has been reported in cancer (Cheng et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 8027, Ruder et al., 2015; AACR Abstract 3576, Dabir et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 7576, Ross et al., 2014; 24978188) and has been associated with clinical response to mTORC1/2 inhibition (Cheng et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 8027, Kristeleit et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 2592). In a genomic study of 1,070 lung cancer cases, focal amplification of RICTOR was detected in 14.6% of small cell lung cancers (7/48), 8.7% of large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas (2/23), 8.4% of adenocarcinomas (61/724), and 7.4% of squamous cell carcinomas (8/108) (FMI_Cheng et al., 2015; 26370156). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of RICTOR alterations in lung cancer are limited (PubMed, Jul 2022). One study reported an association between RICTOR amplification and brain metastases in lung cancer (Tang et al., 2021; 33722707). RICTOR amplification in lung cancer often co_occurs with mutations in KRAS, EGFR, or the PI3K\u2013AKT\u2013mTOR pathway, but has also been characterized as a driver alteration in lung cancer (Cheng et al., 2015; 26370156, Kim et al., 2020; 32801163). RICTOR amplification may indicate sensitivity to mTORC1/2 inhibitors (Cheng et al., 2015; 26370156) or dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors (Wicki et al., 2018; 29660598). A patient with RICTOR_amplified lung adenocarcinoma experienced SD for >18 months upon treatment with the dual mTORC1/2 inhibitor CC_223 (Cheng et al., 2015; 26370156), and a patient with RICTOR_amplified metastatic thymic carcinoma achieved a PR upon treatment with a pan_PI3K/mTORC1/2 inhibitor PQR309 (Wicki et al., 2018; 29660598). In contrast, no clinical benefit was reported for 4 patients with RICTOR_amplified small cell lung cancer treated with the mTORC1/2 inhibitor vistusertib (Park et al., 2020; 32584426) and additional trials of this compound were terminated due to lack of efficacy (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TP53", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "F134C", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"dnaFraction": "90.11", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "F134C"}}, "Interpretation": "Functional loss of the tumor suppressor p53, which is encoded by the TP53 gene, is common in aggressive advanced cancers (Brown et al., 2009; 19935675). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TP53 function or expression (Joerger and Fersht, 2008; 18410249, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130, Zerdoumi et al., 2017; 28472496, Yamada et al., 2007; 17690113). TP53 is one of the most commonly mutated genes in small cell lung cancer (SCLC), with mutations present in 79_92% of tumors (cBio_Rudin et al., 2012; 22941189, cBio_George et al., 2015; 26168399, cBio_Peifer et al., 2012; 22941188). Deletion of TP53 has been reported in 8_52% of SCLC tumors analyzed, which may be higher than in tumors in general (35%) (Voortman et al., 2010; 20615970). TP53 alteration has been reported to be important for SCLC carcinogenesis (Kitamura et al., 2009; 19390995). One study reported significant association between presence of TP53 mutation and worse OS in patients with SCLC with limited disease (Udagawa et al., 2018; 30527185). In a retrospective multi_center study, patients with EGFR_mutated non_small cell lung cancer transformed to small cell lung cancer under EGFR inhibitor therapy experienced high response rates on platinum_etoposide (54% [25/46] ORR, 3.4 median PFS) or taxane (50% [10/20] ORR, 2.7 months median PFS) chemotherapy and a median OS of 10.9 months post_transformation; however, none of the included patients benefitted from treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (0/17 ORR) (Marcoux et al., 2019; 30550363). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633) or p53 gene therapy such as SGT53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628, Leung et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 4139). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% and SDs in 53% of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wildtype (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 32% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 43% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4_C trial for patients with TP53_ and RAS_mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as eprenetapopt. In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, eprenetapopt combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). A Phase 1 trial of eprenetapopt with pembrolizumab for patients with solid tumors reported an ORR of 10% (3/29) (Park et al., 2022; 36084396). Mutations in TP53 or RB1 are characteristic of poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) and may help distinguish NECs from well differentiated or unclearly differentiated tumors (NCCN Neuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors, v2.2022) (Pavel et al., 2020; 32272208, Baudin et al., 2021; 33482246, Rindi et al., 2018; 30140036, Nagtegaal et al., 2020; 31433515, Konukiewitz et al., 2017; 28059098). Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Mutation Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "04", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "04"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor mutation burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen.

This sample harbors a TMB below levels that would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 11063, Lai et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 8556, Dolgin, 2017; 29101156, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Ricciuti et al., 2019; 30922388, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526). Studies of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) reported a median tumor mutational burden (mTMB) of 8_10 Muts/Mb, with 40% of cases harboring a TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb (Rekhtman et al., 2016; 26960398, FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421, Shao et al., 2020; 33119110). In one study, large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas (LCNEC) were reported to have an average nonsynonymous TMB of 10.5 Muts/Mb, which was higher than the TMB of non_small cell lung cancer or SCLC (Rekhtman et al., 2016; 26960398). High tumor mutational burden (TMB) (\u226510 Muts/Mb) in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) not treated with immunotherapy was not significantly associated with OS compared with lower TMB (<10 Muts/Mb) (6.4 vs. 7.4 months, adjusted HR 1.03) in one study (Shao et al., 2020; 33119110). In another study, higher nonsynonymous mutation burden correlated with immune cell infiltration of tumors and higher PD_L1 expression on immune cells in patients with SCLC and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (Kim et al., 2018; 29378266). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In SCLC specifically, the Phase 1/2 CheckMate 032 trial as well as 2 large_scale retrospective analyses reported that patients with tumors harboring TMB \u226513 Muts/Mb experienced higher rates of clinical benefit and longer PFS and OS on treatment with the PD_1 inhibitors pembrolizumab or nivolumab (alone or in combination with ipilimumab) or the PD_L1 inhibitor atezolizumab, compared with patients with tumors with TMB <13 Muts/Mb (based on this assay or others) (Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 11063, Lai et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 8556, Dolgin, 2017; 29101156, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Ricciuti et al., 2019; 30922388). In multiple pan_tumor studies, increased tissue tumor mutational burden (TMB) was associated with sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947, Ott et al., 2019; 30557521, Cristescu et al., 2022; 35101941, Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). In the KEYNOTE 158 trial of pembrolizumab monotherapy for patients with solid tumors, significant improvement in ORR was observed for patients with TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb (as measured by this assay) compared with those with TMB <10 Muts/Mb in a large cohort that included multiple tumor types (Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526); similar findings were observed in the KEYNOTE 028 and 012 trials (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915). At the same TMB cutpoint, retrospective analysis of patients with solid tumors treated with any checkpoint inhibitor identified that tissue TMB scores \u2265 10 Muts/Mb were associated with prolonged time to treatment failure compared with scores <10 muts/Mb (HR=0.68) (Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). For patients with solid tumors treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab in the CheckMate 848 trial, improved responses were observed in patients with a tissue TMB \u2265 10 Muts/Mb independent of blood TMB at any cutpoint in matched samples (Schenker at al., 2022; AACR Abstract 7845). However, support for higher TMB thresholds and efficacy was observed in the prospective Phase 2 MyPathway trial of atezolizumab for patients with pan_solid tumors, where improved ORR and DCR was seen in patients with TMB \u2265 16 Muts/Mb than those with TMB \u2265 10 and <16 Muts/Mb (Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409). Similarly, analyses across several solid tumor types reported that patients with higher TMB (defined as \u226516_20 Muts/Mb) achieved greater clinical benefit from PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting monotherapy compared with patients with higher TMB treated with chemotherapy (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000) or those with lower TMB treated with PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting agents (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene": "CCNE1", "Alteration": "amplification", "Title": "The Safety and Pharmacokinetics Preliminary Efficacy of IMP7068 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1", "Target": "WEE1", "Locations": "Taipei (Taiwan), Taoyuan (Taiwan), Taichung (Taiwan), Tainan (Taiwan), Shanghai (China), Wuhan (China), Beijing (China), Chengdu (China), Kansas, Texas", "NCTID": "NCT04768868", "Note": "Strong preclinical and clinical data suggest that CCNE1 amplification may predict sensitivity to WEE1 inhibitors.
