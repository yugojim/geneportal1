APC interacts with beta_catenin and controls signaling in the WNT pathway, which regulates embryonic development and cell differentiation (Logan and Nusse, 2004; 15473860). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt APC function or expression (Eklof et al., 2001; 11707392, Liu et al., 2006; 16753179, Dikovskaya et al., 2010; 20144988, Murphy et al., 2007; 17410430, Aretz et al., 2004; 15459959). APC mutations have been found in 73% of tumors in the colorectal adenocarcinoma TCGA dataset (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696). In 1 study, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of APC was observed in 32% of colorectal cancer (CRC) samples (Christie et al., 2013; 23085758). The prognostic significance of APC mutations in sporadic CRC remains unclear (Quyn et al., 2008; 19110823). Solid tumors with WNT/beta_catenin pathway alterations, as seen here, were observed to have significantly less T_cell inflammation in one study (Luke et al., 2019; 30635339). There are no approved drugs targeting APC inactivation in cancer. Loss of APC function leads to accumulation of beta_catenin and upregulation of WNT pathway transcription programs (Zhan et al., 2017; 27617575), and potential therapeutic approaches to target this pathway include CBP/beta_catenin antagonists, which interfere with the ability of beta_catenin to interact with transcriptional co_activator CBP (Jung et al., 2020; 32037398, Krishnamurthy and Kurzrock, 2018; 29169144). In a Phase 1 trial of the CBP/beta_catenin antagonist E7386, 1 patient with APC_mutated small bowel adenocarcinoma achieved a PR with tumor shrinkage of _69% and response duration of 165 days (Kawazoe et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 473P); preclinical data support sensitivity of APC_deficient gastric or colorectal cancer models to E7386 (Yamada et al., 2021; 33408116, Kanda et al., 2022; 34837838). Germline mutations in APC are found in more than 90% of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) (Kerr et al., 2013; 23159591, Fearon, 2011; 21090969, Kastritis et al., 2009; 18844223).

Like CRAF, alteration of ARAF in cancer is thought to be rare compared to BRAF due to the requirement of activating phosphorylation of its negative_charge regulatory region (Emuss et al., 2005; 16266992). ARAF overexpression and activating mutations have been reported to transform cultured cells and to hyperactivate the MEK_ERK MAPK pathway (Imielinski et al., 2014; 24569458). ARAF has been reported to be amplified in cancer (Gao et al., 2013; 23550210) and may be biologically relevant in this context (Zack et al., 2013; 24071852, Beroukhim et al., 2010; 20164920). ARAF mutation and amplification have been detected in 2% and 0.2% of cases in the MSKCC Metastatic Colorectal Cancer dataset, respectively (Yaeger et al., 2018; 29316426). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of ARAF alterations in colorectal cancer are limited (PubMed, Mar 2023). ARAF activating mutations may predict sensitivity to pan_RAF and MEK inhibitors. In a preclinical study, cell transformation and hyperactivation of the MAPK pathway as a result of ARAF activation was reportedly inhibited by the MEK inhibitor trametinib and the pan_RAF inhibitor sorafenib (Imielinski et al., 2014; 24569458). Furthermore, 1 patient with Stage 4 lung adenocarcinoma whose tumor harbored the activating ARAF mutation S214C experienced a near_complete response and 5_year PFS upon sorafenib treatment (Imielinski et al., 2014; 24569458).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "ARAF activating mutations may lead to increased RAF activity and subsequent activation of the MEK pathway and may predict sensitivity to therapies targeting these pathways.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04803318", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04985604", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03284502", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03905148", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05580770", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04551521", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04720976", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05159245", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04817956", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05340621", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "CCND2", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "CCND2 encodes the protein cyclin D2, which binds and regulates the cyclin_dependent kinases that control cell cycle progression, and is a downstream target of cancer signaling pathways including hedgehog and PI3K (Katoh and Katoh, 2009; 19860666, White et al., 2006; 16301994). CCND2 has been reported to be amplified in cancer (Gao et al., 2013; 23550210), and may be biologically relevant in this context (Zack et al., 2013; 24071852, Beroukhim et al., 2010; 20164920). In the Colorectal Adenocarcinoma TCGA dataset, putative high_level amplification of CCND2 has been found in 1.4% of cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696). Cyclin D2 has also reportedly been overexpressed in 53% of colorectal adenocarcinomas (Mermelshtein et al., 2005; 16012517). Overexpression of CCND2 mRNA in CRC has been correlated with poor patient prognosis (Liu et al., 2010; 21052002). In addition, the expression of cyclin D2 at the invasive margin has been associated with liver metastasis in colorectal cancer, and in patients with Stage 1 and 2 tumors, cyclin D2 expression has also been associated with reduced patient survival (Sarkar et al., 2010; 19508551). Although preclinical studies suggest that cyclin D2 activates CDK4/6 (Busk et al., 2005; 15707582, Busk, 2003; 12695654), it is unknown whether CCND2 amplification or activating mutation predicts response to CDK4/6 inhibitors such as abemaciclib, palbociclib, and ribociclib.

Mutations in KRAS have been reported in approximately 35_50% of colorectal cancers (CRCs) (Lievre et al., 2006; 16618717, De Roock et al., 2011; 21163703, Chen et al., 2014; 25367198, Li et al., 2015; 25929517, Hu et al., 2016; 27977612, Zekri et al., 2017; 28218784, Staudacher et al., 2017; 29048416, Wang et al., 2018; 29705968, Guo et al., 2018; 29666387). Numerous studies have reported that KRAS mutations are associated with increased metastasis, adverse clinicopathological features, and shorter survival of patients with CRC (Chen et al., 2014; 25367198, Li et al., 2015; 25929517, Hu et al., 2016; 27977612, M\u00e1rmol et al., 2017; 28106826, Zekri et al., 2017; 28218784, Kwak et al., 2017; 28858102). Preclinical evidence suggests that KRAS activation may predict sensitivity to MEK inhibitors, such as trametinib, binimetinib, cobimetinib, and selumetinib (Nakano et al., 1984; 6320174, Pylayeva_Gupta et al., 2011; 21993244, Yamaguchi et al., 2011; 21523318, Watanabe et al., 2013; 23438367, Gilmartin et al., 2011; 21245089, Yeh et al., 2009; 19372556). However, multiple clinical trials have reported lack of efficacy of trametinib and other MEK inhibitors when used as monotherapy for treatment of patients with KRAS_mutant CRC (Tsimberidou et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract e22086)(Infante et al., 2012; 22805291, Zimmer et al., 2014; 24947927, Bennouna et al., 2011; 20127139, Weekes et al., 2013; 23434733). Both clinical (Hochster et al., 2013; ASCO GI Abstract 380, Juric et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 9051) and preclinical (Lamba et al., 2014; 25199829, Sun et al, 2014; 24685132) studies suggest that combinatorial approaches including MEK inhibitors are likely to be more effective for the treatment of CRC, including strategies such as combination of MEK inhibitors with PI3K inhibitors (Juric et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 9051), RAF inhibitors (Lamba et al., 2014; 25199829), pan_ERBB inhibitors (Sun et al, 2014; 24685132), or chemotherapeutic agents (Hochster et al., 2013; ASCO GI Abstract 380). In a Phase 1 study evaluating the MEK_pan_RAF dual inhibitor CH5126766, 6 patients harboring KRAS mutations experienced PRs, including 3 with non_small cell lung cancer (NCSLC), 1 with low_grade serous ovarian carcinoma (LGSOC), 1 with endometrial adenocarcinoma, and 1 with multiple myeloma (Guo et al., 2020; 33128873). Combination of CH5126766 with the FAK inhibitor defactinib elicited PR rates of 50% (4/8) for patients with KRAS_mutated LGSOC and 12% (2/17) for patients with KRAS_mutated NSCLC in a Phase 1 study (Krebs et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT019, Shinde et al., 2020; AACR Abstract CT143). Preclinical and clinical data suggest that KRAS mutations may predict clinical benefit from SHP2 inhibitors (Lu et al., 2019; 31068384, Mainardi et al., 2018; 29808006, Koczywas et al., 2021; AACR Abstract LB001, Brana et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 3005, Bendell et al., 2020; EORTC_NCI_AACR Abstract 5). A Phase 1 study of RMC_4630 for relapsed/refractory solid tumors reported a DCR of 58% (23/40) for patients with NSCLC and KRAS mutations and a DCR of 75% (12/16) for patients with NSCLC and KRAS G12C mutations (Koczywas et al., 2021; AACR Abstract LB001). Interim results from a Phase 1/2 study of RMC_4630 plus cobimetinib reported tumor reduction in 3 of 8 patients with KRAS_mutated colorectal cancer (Bendell et al., 2020; EORTC_NCI_AACR Abstract 5). Preclinical studies suggest that KRAS activating mutations may confer sensitivity to SOS1 inhibitors such as BI_3406, MRTX0902, BI_1701963, and BAY_293 as single agents (Hofmann et al., 2021; 32816843, He et al., 2022; 36173339, Zhang et al., 2022; 36384290, Liu et al., 2023; 36793426, Ramharter et al., 2021; 33719426, Ketcham et al., 2022; 35833726) or in combination with covalent KRAS G12C inhibitors (Ketcham et al., 2022; 35833726, Haling et al., 2022; AACR Abstract ND02, Savarese et al., 2021; AACR Abstract 1271) and MEK inhibitors (Haling et al., 2022; AACR Abstract ND02, Norgard et al., 2022 AACR Tumor Immunology and Immunotherapy Abstract B23, Hofmann et al., 2022; AACR Abstract 3255, Plangger et al., 2022; 36048281, Ma et al., 2022; 36139627). Preclinical and limited clinical evidence suggest that KRAS mutation may predict sensitivity to PLK1 inhibitors (Luo et al., 2009; 19490893, Lenz et al., 2020; ASCO GI Abstract TPS265). A Phase 1b/2 study of PLK1 inhibitor onvansertib in combination with FOLFIRI and bevacizumab for patients with KRAS_mutated metastatic CRC previously treated with chemotherapy reported an 87.5% (7/8; 3 PR, 4 SD) clinical benefit rate, with 1 patient going on to successful curative surgery (Barzi et al., 2020; AACR Abstract CT235). Preclinical and clinical data suggest that KRAS G12D mutations may predict clinical benefit from KRAS G12D_targeted, T_cell_receptor_based adoptive cell therapy (Leidner et al., 2022; 35648703, Tran et al., 2016; 27959684, Wang et al., 2015; 26701267). Case studies of KRAS G12D_targeted, T_cell_receptor_based adoptive cell therapy have reported PRs for pretreated patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Leidner et al., 2022; 35648703) or colorectal cancer (CRC) (Tran et al., 2016; 27959684). Preclinical data suggests that KRAS G12D mutations may predict sensitivity to KRAS G12D small_molecule inhibitors, such as MRTX1133 (Wang et al., 2022; 34889605, Kemp et al., 2023; 36472553, Hallin et al., 2022; 36216931, Issahaku et al., 2022; 36273239, Xiang et al., 2023; 36844555) and RMC9805 (Jiang et al., 2023; AACR Abstract 526). Activating mutations in KRAS or NRAS are associated with lack of clinical benefit from cetuximab (Van Cutsem et al., 2011; 21502544, Bokemeyer et al., 2011; 21228335, Karapetis et al., 2008; 18946061, De Roock et al., 2008; 17998284) or panitumumab (Douillard et al., 2014; 24718886, Douillard et al., 2012; 24024839, Amado et al., 2008; 18316791) for patients with CRC.

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS colorectal cancers (CRCs) make up 70_85% of CRC cases (Guastadisegni et al., 2010; 20627535, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696, Jass, 2007; 17204026, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894). MSS colorectal cancers are molecularly heterogeneous, driven by diverse mechanisms such as extensive DNA methylation, oncogenic mutations in KRAS or BRAF, or chromosomal instability (Jass, 2007; 17204026). Multiple studies have shown that MSS CRCs have a worse prognosis than MSI_high tumors (Samowitz et al., 2001; 11535541, Elsaleh and Iacopetta, 2001; 12445368, Brueckl et al., 2003; 12820457, Guidoboni et al., 2001; 11438476, Gryfe et al., 2000; 10631274, Sinicrope et al., 2006; 16952542, Guastadisegni et al., 2010; 20627535, Laghi and Malesci, 2012; 22722556). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60). For patients with chemotherapy_refractory microsatellite_stable (MSS) metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), a Phase 3 trial reported no OS advantage from the combination of the PD_L1 inhibitor atezolizumab plus cobimetinib relative to regorafenib (8.9 vs. 8.5 months, HR=1.00); atezolizumab monotherapy similarly did not prolong OS (7.1 vs. 8.5 months, HR=1.19) (Ciardiello et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract LBA_004). For patients with MSS CRC, a Phase 2 study combining ipilimumab and nivolumab reported an overall DCR of 25% (10/40) (Parikh et al., 2021; DOI: 10.1038/s43018_021_00269_7). Two Phase 1 studies for patients with MSS CRC treated with regorafenib and nivolumab reported PFSs of 7.9 months (Fukuoka et al., 2020; 32343640) and 5.7 months (Kim et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1016/j.annonc.2020.04.073), and a patient with MSS CRC refractory to chemotherapy treated with the PD_1 inhibitor sintilimab and regorafenib reported a CR (Zhang et al., 2021; 34688262).

Patients with MSS CRC are more likely to benefit from postsurgical fluorouracil (FU)_based adjuvant therapy (Ribic et al., 2003; 12867608, Sargent et al., 2010; 20498393) but less likely to benefit from irinotecan chemotherapy (Fallik et al., 2003; 14522894).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "NRAS", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "wildtype", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "wildtype"}}, "Interpretation": "NRAS encodes a member of the RAS family of small GTPases that mediate transduction of growth signals.

Activating mutations in either KRAS (Douillard et al., 2014; 24718886, Douillard et al., 2012; 24024839, Amado et al., 2008; 18316791) or NRAS (Douillard et al., 2013; 24024839, Peeters et al., 2013; 23325582), which function downstream of EGFR, are associated with lack of benefit of panitumumab for patients with CRC and indicate against the use of panitumumab (NCCN Colon Cancer Guidelines v3.2022, NCCN Rectal Cancer Guidelines v4.2022). </p> <p><b>Supporting Data:</b> Panitumumab has been shown to improve OS, PFS, and ORR for patients with KRAS_wildtype colorectal cancer (CRC), both in combination with FOLFOX4, FOLFIRI, irinotecan, or best supportive care (Douillard et al., 2014; 24718886, Peeters et al., 2015; 26341920, Watanabe et al., 2022; 35723084, Kim et al., 2018; 29703606, Shitara et al., 2016; 27712015), and as monotherapy for chemotherapy_refractory patients (Price et al., 2014; 24739896, Van Cutsem et al., 2007; 17470858, Peeters et al., 2013; 23325582). The Phase 3 PARADIGM trial comparing panitumumab plus mFOLFOX6 versus bevacizumab plus mFOLFOX6 as first_line treatment for patients with RAS_wildtype left_sided metastatic CRC demonstrated that treatment with panitumumab significantly improved median OS (mOS; 36.2 months vs. 31.3 months) compared with bevacizumab (Yoshino et al., 2022; ASCO Abstract LBA1). A Phase 2 trial reported that, for patients with unresectable RAS_wildtype colorectal adenocarcinoma treated with panitumumab plus FOLFOX4, maintenance with a combination of panitumumab plus fluorouracil and leucovorin was superior to panitumumab monotherapy (10_month PFS OF 59% vs. 49%)(Pietrantonio et al., 2019; 31268481). In the Phase 3 ASPECCT study, panitumumab was found to be non_inferior to cetuximab with respect to median OS (10.4 vs. 10.0 months, HR=0.97) for patients with previously treated KRAS exon 2 wildtype metastatic colorectal cancer; median PFS was also similar between the two treatment groups (4.4 vs. 4.1 months, HR=1.00)(Price et al., 2014; 24739896). In a similar patient population, a Phase 2 study of combination panitumumab and irinotecan versus combination cetuximab and irinotecan also demonstrated non_inferiority with respect to median PFS (5.4 vs. 4.3 months, HR = 0.64) and median OS (14.9 vs. 11.5 months, HR=0.66)(Sakai et al., 2020; 32526634). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Resistant", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "SMAD4", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "loss", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "loss"}}, "Interpretation": "SMAD4, also known as DPC4, encodes a tumor suppressor that regulates transcriptional activity downstream of TGF_beta receptor signaling (Massague et al., 2012; 22992590, Massague et al., 2008; 18662538). SMAD4 alterations that result in loss or disruption of the MH1 domain (aa 18_142), MH2 domain (aa 323_552), or SAD domain (aa 275_320) are predicted to be inactivating (Massague et al., 2005; 16322555, Mor\u00e9n et al., 2000; 10980615, Xu and Attisano, 2000; 10781087, Luo et al., 1999; 10485843, Jones and Kern, 2000; 10871368, Fink et al., 2001; 11196171, De Bosscher et al., 2004; 14715079, Shi et al., 1997; 9214508, Miyaki et al., 1999; 10340381, Prokova et al., 2007; 17994767, Wu et al., 2001; 11274206, Ding et al., 2009; 19139564, Kuang et al., 2004; 14647410, Watanabe et al., 2000; 11265759, Bosscher et al., 2004; 14715079). SMAD4 mutation or homozygous deletion is most frequently observed in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (43%)(cBio_Witkiewicz et al., 2015; 25855536), pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma (26%)(Jiao et al., 2014; 24293293), cholangiocarcinoma (25%)(Churi et al., 2014; 25536104), small intestine cancer (20%) (Takeda et al., 2022; ASCO GI Abstract 642), appendiceal adenocarcinoma (14_20% mutation; 57% deletion)(Liu et al., 2014; 24821835, Maru et al., 2004; 14647445), colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC; 14%)(Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696), esophageal adenocarcinoma (14%)(Wang et al., 2015; 26336083), and stomach adenocarcinoma (13%)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079317). In preclinical studies, SMAD4 loss of function has been implicated in the development of mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas, including mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCN)(Izeradjene et al., 2007; 17349581) and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN)(Bardeesy et al., 2006; 17114584); in clinical samples, SMAD4 homozygous deletion has been observed in 10% of IPMNs and 8% of MCNs, and mutation was also observed in 5% of IPMNs (Springer et al., 2015; 26253305). SMAD4 gene alterations have been associated with reduced OS for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Blackford et al., 2009; 19584151). Reduced SMAD4 expression has been associated with worse prognosis in various cancer types, including CRC (Yan et al., 2016; 26861460, Kozak et al., 2015; 25681512, Roth et al., 2012; 23104212), appendiceal mucinous neoplasm (Davison et al., 2014; 24618609), gastric adenocarcinoma (Kim et al., 2004; 15033661, Xiangming et al., 2001; 11234879), esophageal adenocarcinoma (Singhi et al., 2015; 25634752), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (Natsugoe et al., 2002; 12060625), breast cancer (de Kruijf et al., 2013; 23022998), and prostate cancer (Shipitsin et al., 2014; 25032733). There are no targeted therapies available to address genomic alterations in SMAD4. Preclinical studies in colorectal cancer have reported associations of SMAD4 inactivation or loss with sensitivity to inhibitors of Aurora kinase A (Shi et al., 2022; 35393542) and the Wnt/beta_catenin pathway (Park et al., 2022; 35274815). Clinical studies have reported associations of SMAD4 loss or low SMAD4 expression with improved responses to chemotherapeutic agents in patients with pancreatic cancer (Ormanns et al., 2017; 28534865, Fei et al., 2021; 34002944, Bachet et al., 2012; 22377565) and non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Ziemke et al., 2017; 28577946). Other clinical studies in pancreatic cancer have reported an association of high SMAD4 expression with better responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Kassardjian and Wang, 2020; 32897998) and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (Pen et al., 2021; 33667587). Germline SMAD4 mutations, including those at the R361 hotspot, have been observed in patients with juvenile polyposis syndrome (Houlston et al., 1998; 9811934, Woodford_Richens et al., 2000; 10764709, Howe et al., 2004; 15235019, Howe et al., 2004; 15235019, Howe et al., 2004; 15235019), which is associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal cancers (Brosens et al., 2011; 22171123). The penetrance of deleterious SMAD4 mutations in patients with colon cancer is estimated at 20% by age 35 and 70% by age 65 (Kalia et al., 2017; 27854360). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of SMAD4 is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Mutation Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "04", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "04"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor mutation burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen. TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB below levels that would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Fabrizio et al., 2018; 30151257, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526). Elevated tumor mutational burden (TMB) has been reported in 8_25% of colorectal cancer (CRC) samples (George et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3587, Nagahashi et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract e15103, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117, Shao et al., 2020; 33119110). Multiple studies have reported that up to 90% of hypermutated CRC cases exhibit high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI_H) and mismatch repair deficiency (MMR_D) (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117). Increased TMB is significantly associated with MSI_H and MMR_D, with studies reporting that 100% of MSI_H CRCs harbor elevated TMB and conversely that 100% of tumors with low TMB harbor intact MMR (George et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3587, Nagahashi et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract e15103, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117). A subset of CRCs that harbor increased TMB but not MSI_H are driven by mutations in POLE, which leads to an \u201cultramutated\u201d phenotype with especially high TMB (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117). Tumors with increased TMB harbor BRAF V600E mutations more frequently than those with low TMB (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117), whereas TMB_low tumors more frequently harbor mutations in TP53 and APC (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696). The prognostic value of tumor mutational burden (TMB) in colorectal cancer (CRC) is context_ and therapy_dependent. A study of tissue TMB (tTMB) in 145 CRC samples showed longer OS in TMB_high samples compared with TMB_low ones (Schwartz et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 572). Similarly, for patients with metastatic CRC treated with first_line chemotherapy combined with bevacizumab or cetuximab, high tissue TMB (tTMB_H) was associated with longer OS (Innocenti et al., 2019; 30865548). For patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, tTMB_H was associated with better 5_year relapse_free survival (Lee et al., 2019; 31285374). However, for patients with EGFR/BRAF_inhibitor_treated, BRAF_mutated microsatellite stable (MSS) metastatic CRC, intermediate tTMB was associated with significantly poorer PFS and OS compared with TMB_low status; patients with primary resistance to EGFR/BRAF blockage had higher TMB than those sensitive to these therapies (Randon et al., 2022; 34933155). In a study for 61 patients with metastatic, MSS CRC treated with best standard of care, plasma TMB scores \u226528 Muts/Mb (approximately 14 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) were associated with reduced OS compared with plasma TMB scores <28 Muts/Mb (3.0 vs. 5.3 months, HR=0.76, p=0.007), whereas tTMB was not found to be prognostic in this population (Chen et al., 2020; 32379280, Loree et al., 2021; ASCO GI Abstract 61). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In multiple pan_tumor studies, increased tissue tumor mutational burden (TMB) was associated with sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947, Ott et al., 2019; 30557521, Cristescu et al., 2022; 35101941, Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). In the KEYNOTE 158 trial of pembrolizumab monotherapy for patients with solid tumors, significant improvement in ORR was observed for patients with TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb (as measured by this assay) compared with those with TMB <10 Muts/Mb in a large cohort that included multiple tumor types (Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526); similar findings were observed in the KEYNOTE 028 and 012 trials (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915). At the same TMB cutpoint, retrospective analysis of patients with solid tumors treated with any checkpoint inhibitor identified that tissue TMB scores \u2265 10 Muts/Mb were associated with prolonged time to treatment failure compared with scores <10 muts/Mb (HR=0.68) (Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). For patients with solid tumors treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab in the CheckMate 848 trial, improved responses were observed in patients with a tissue TMB \u2265 10 Muts/Mb independent of blood TMB at any cutpoint in matched samples (Schenker at al., 2022; AACR Abstract 7845). However, support for higher TMB thresholds and efficacy was observed in the prospective Phase 2 MyPathway trial of atezolizumab for patients with pan_solid tumors, where improved ORR and DCR was seen in patients with TMB \u2265 16 Muts/Mb than those with TMB \u2265 10 and <16 Muts/Mb (Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409). Similarly, analyses across several solid tumor types reported that patients with higher TMB (defined as \u226516_20 Muts/Mb) achieved greater clinical benefit from PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting monotherapy compared with patients with higher TMB treated with chemotherapy (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000) or those with lower TMB treated with PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting agents (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386). In CRC specifically, a retrospective analysis of immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy reported significantly improved OS for patients with tumors harboring TMB \u22659.8 Muts/MB compared with those with tumors with TMB <9.8 Muts/Mb (~ equivalency <12 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) (Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254). Another retrospective study reported that a TMB \u226512 Muts/Mb cutoff identifies >99% of MSI_High CRC cases but only 3% of MSS cases, indicating the utility of this cutoff for identification of patients with CRC likely to benefit from treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (Fabrizio et al., 2018; 30151257).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null,
