Although PD_L1 is a costimulatory molecule for naive T_cells, it can provide inhibitory signals to activated T_cells through interactions with the receptors PD_1 or CD80 (Keir et al., 2008; 18173375, Butte et al., 2007; 17629517). These signals can help PD_L1_expressing tumor cells evade immune detection by natural killer cells or T_cells (Benson et al., 2010; 20460501, Iwai et al., 2002; 12218188, Liu et al., 2007; 17363736). CD274 amplification is associated with positive PD_L1 protein expression in solid tumors (Huang et al., 2021; 32884129, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079317, George et al., 2017; 27620277) and lymphomas (Ansell et al., 2015; 25482239, Green et al., 2010; 20628145). CD274 amplification has been observed in <1% of CNS tumors in a retrospective pan_tumor study (Huang et al., 2021; 32884129). However, PD_L1 protein expression has been detected in 61_88% of GBM (Nduom et al., 2016; 26323609, Bergoff et al., 2015; 25355681, Preusser et al., 2015; 26501438) and in 86% (18/21) grade 3 gliomas (Berghoff et al., 2015; European Cancer Congress Abstract 2926). Apart from membranous PD_L1 staining, one study observed diffuse/fibrillary PD_L1 expression in a high fraction of GBM specimens (Bergoff et al., 2015; 25355681). PD_L1 protein positivity did not correlate with patient outcomes (Nduom et al., 2016; 26323609, Bergoff et al., 2015; 25355681), although membranous PD_L1 expression in at least 5% of tumor cells associated with shorter survival in the secondary analysis of one study (Nduom et al., 2016; 26323609), which is supported by a small dataset of 17 glioblastoma cases (Liu et al., 2013; 23986257). The prognostic role of high PD_L1 gene expression in glioma and GBM is not clear. Two studies have reported a significant correlation with shorter survival (Wang et al., 2016; 27999734, Nduom et al., 2016; 26323609), whereas another study observed no association (Bergoff et al., 2015; 25355681). Preclinical data in murine GBM models suggest that anti_PD_1 blockade alone or combined with other therapies may be an effective therapeutic strategy against malignant gliomas (Reardon et al., 2016; 26546453, Zeng et al., 2013; 23462419, Wainwright et al., 2014; 24691018). On the basis of strong clinical evidence, CD274 amplification and PD_L1 overexpression may predict sensitivity to antibodies targeting PD_L1 or PD_1. Patients with high tumor PD_L1 expression across multiple solid tumor types have exhibited improved clinical benefit with the PD_L1 antibodies atezolizumab (Martin_Liberal et al., 2015; ESMO Symposium on Immuno_Oncology Abstract 24P, Fehrenbacher et al., 2016; 26970723, Herbst et al., 2014; 25428504), toripalimab (Jiang et al., 2021; EMSO Abstract 1310P, Tang et al., 2020; 32321714, Tang et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract e21522, Xu et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 4021, Wang et al., 2019; 31236579, Xu et al., 2021; 33345750, Yonglong et al., 2021; 34678907, Xu et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract LBA2, Mai et al., 2021; 34341578, Wang et al., 2021; 33492986, Sheng et al., 2021; 34740921), and durvalumab (Powles et al., 2017; ASCO Genitourinary Abstract 286, Massard et al., 2016; 27269937, Bais et al., 2017; AACR Abstract 3720/5, Garassino et al., 2016; IASLC Abstract PLO4a.03, Segal et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 3011, Rebelatto et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 8033). The PD_1 antibodies pembrolizumab, nivolumab (alone or in combination with ipilimumab), and tislelizumab have elicited significant clinical responses for patients with solid tumors (Kefford et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 3005, Groschel et al., 2016; 27900363, Hellman et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 3001, Sharma et al., 2020; 3291612, Wolchok et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 9505, Motzer et al., 2018; 29562145, Escudier et al., 2017; ESMO Abstract LBA5, Shen et al., 2022; 35442766) and for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma, a tumor type that harbors frequent PD_L1 copy number gains (Ansell et al., 2015; ASH Abstract 583, Ansell et al., 2015; 25482239). However, studies evaluating nivolumab for patients with urothelial carcinoma or tislelizumab plus sitravatinib for patients with non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have shown no correlation between clinical benefit and PD_L1 expression levels (Sharma et al., 2018; AACR abstract CT178, Qing et al., 2022; ESMO TAT abstract 2P). A Phase 1 trial evaluating bintrafusp alfa, a fusion protein targeting TGF_beta and PD_L1, reported ORRs of 37% (10/27) and 86% (6/7) for patients with NSCLC characterized as PD_L1_positive or having high PD_L1 expression, respectively (Paz_Ares et al., 2020; 32173464). Preclinical studies have demonstrated that JAK2 amplification regulates PD_L1 expression (Green et al., 2010; 20628145, Derenzini et al., 2011; 22829094); therefore, JAK2 inhibitors such as ruxolitinib may also be relevant for patients with PD_L1 amplification.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "CD274 (PD_L1) amplification or rearrangements that disrupt the 3  untranslated region (UTR) may promote PD_1 signaling and inhibit the antitumor immune response.

Neurofibromin acts as a tumor suppressor by repressing RAS signaling (Morcos et al., 1996; 8628317). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt NF1 function or expression (Ballester et al., 1990; 2121371, Xu et al., 1990; 2116237, Martin et al., 1990; 2121370, Thomas et al., 2012; 22807134, Skuse and Cappione, 1997; 9300663, Morcos et al., 1996; 8628317, Messiaen et al., 1999; 11258625, Ars et al., 2000; 10607834, Messiaen and Wimmer, 2005; 15863657, Poullet et al., 1994; 8264648). NF1 mutation has been observed in 5_6% of lower grade gliomas and 9_14% of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cases; homozygous deletion of NF1 was observed in 1% of lower grade gliomas and 2_3% of GBMs (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26061751, cBio_Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2008; 18772890).

A preclinical study suggests that combined mTOR and MEK inhibition is effective in a model of NF1_deficient malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) (Malone et al., 2014; 24913553).

Additionally, case studies of trametinib monotherapy for NF1_associated brain tumors have reported PRs for 3 patients with low_grade glioma, 5 patients with astrocytoma, 1 patient with an optic pathway glioma, and 1 patient with a GBM (Manoharan et al., 2020; 32780261, Kondyli et al., 2018; 30097824, Ronsley et al., 2021; 33939292, Lucas et al., 2022; 35945463, Romo et al., 2019; SNO Abstract RARE_54, Awada et al., 2020; 33082744). A minor response was reported for 1 patient with glioma on cobimetinib (Trippett et al., 2022; 35715627). A study of 2 pediatric patients with optic astrocytomas harboring BRAF duplications reported clinical benefit in response to trametinib with reductions in tumor volume (56_66%) and treatment ongoing at 484 and 468 days (Miller et al., 2016; 28009226). A study of 5 patients with KIAA1549_BRAF_fusion_positive pilocytic astrocytoma reported 1 PR and 3 minor responses (Kondyli et al., 2018; 30097824) and, similarly, a patient with low_grade glioma harboring this fusion benefited from trametinib (Wagner et al., 2018; 29369501). A patient with pilocytic astrocytoma harboring an NFIA_RAF1 fusion who had progressed on multiple lines of prior treatment exhibited ongoing SD following treatment with trametinib (Yde et al., 2016; 27810072). Whereas frequent adverse events precluded a recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule for the combination of trametinib and everolimus in a Phase 1b trial for solid tumors (Tolcher et al., 2014; 25344362), a retrospective study for heavily pretreated patients with solid tumors reported tolerable regimens of the combination for 23/31 patients, with 16 patients treated >3 months and evaluable patients achieving a median PFS of 6.5 months (Patterson et al., 2018; AACR Abstract 3891). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT03239015", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04803318", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04985604", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05125523", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03905148", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05580770", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04720976", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05036226", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05159245", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04817956", "Include": "true"}]}}, {"Name": "Y489*", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"dnaFraction": "27.53", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "Y489*"}}, "Interpretation": "NF1 encodes neurofibromin, a GTPase_activating protein (GAP) that is a key negative regulator of the RAS signaling pathway (Hattori et al., 1991; 1904223). Neurofibromin acts as a tumor suppressor by repressing RAS signaling (Morcos et al., 1996; 8628317). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt NF1 function or expression (Ballester et al., 1990; 2121371, Xu et al., 1990; 2116237, Martin et al., 1990; 2121370, Thomas et al., 2012; 22807134, Skuse and Cappione, 1997; 9300663, Morcos et al., 1996; 8628317, Messiaen et al., 1999; 11258625, Ars et al., 2000; 10607834, Messiaen and Wimmer, 2005; 15863657, Poullet et al., 1994; 8264648). NF1 mutation has been observed in 5_6% of lower grade gliomas and 9_14% of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cases; homozygous deletion of NF1 was observed in 1% of lower grade gliomas and 2_3% of GBMs (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26061751, cBio_Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2008; 18772890). Among GBM subtypes, NF1 mutation and loss were reported most frequently in the mesenchymal subtype, 37% (14/28) and 38% (21/55) of cases, respectively (Verhaak et al., 2010; 20129251). NF1 loss was significantly associated with decreased overall and disease_specific survival in patients with lower grade gliomas (II_III), but not in those with GBM (Vizcaino et al., 2015; 26190195).

On the basis of limited clinical data (Lim et al., 2016; 26859683 , Weiss et al., 2015; 25314964, Janku et al., 2014; 24931142) and preclinical data (Johannessen et al., 2008; 18164202, Johannessen et al., 2005; 15937108), loss or inactivation of NF1 may predict sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors, including everolimus and temsirolimus. A preclinical study suggests that combined mTOR and MEK inhibition is effective in a model of NF1_deficient malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) (Malone et al., 2014; 24913553). One or more of the NF1 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (ClinVar, Apr 2023)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in NF1 cause the autosomal dominant disorder neurofibromatosis type 1, which is characterized in part by increased risk of developing various tumors, including sarcoma, glioma, breast carcinoma, and neuroendocrine and hematological neoplasms (Jett and Friedman, 2010; 20027112, Patil and Chamberlain, 2012; 22240541, Evans et al., 2012; 23036231). Estimates for the prevalence of the disorder in the general population range from 1:2,500 to 1:3,000 (Upadhyaya et al., 1995; 8544190, Williams et al., 2009; 19117870), and in the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of NF1 is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "On the basis of clinical evidence and strong preclinical evidence, NF1 inactivation may predict sensitivity to MEK inhibitors.

PD_1 signaling, which can be stimulated by PD_L2, results in  T_cell exhaustion , a temporary inhibition of activation and proliferation that can be reversed on removal of the PD_1 signal (Keir et al., 2008; 18173375, Butte et al., 2007; 17629517). Amplification of PDCD1LG2 and the adjacent locus CD274, encoding PD_L1, has been reported in 29% of primary mediastinal B_cell lymphoma (PMBCL) cases, and PDCD1LG2 copy number gain has been reported to correlate with increased PD_L2 protein expression as determined by immunohistochemistry (Twa et al., 2014; 24497532, Shi et al., 2014; 25025450). PDCD1LG2 amplification was detected in fewer than 1% of caes in the TCGA Brain Lower Grade Glioma and Glioblastoma datasets, while putative homozygous PDCD1LG2 deletion was observed in 0.78% and 1.5% of cases, respectively (cBioPortal, Feb 2023)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). Preclinical data in murine models suggest that anti_PD_1 blockade alone or combined with other therapies may be an effective therapeutic strategy against malignant gliomas (Reardon et al., 2016; 26546453, Zeng et al., 2013; 23462419, Wainwright et al., 2014; 24691018). Analysis of the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) and TCGA datasets found that PD_L2 expression was upregulated in higher grade and IDH wild_type glioma, and that PD_L2 expression was linked to unfavorable prognosis independent of other variables including age, grade, IDH status, and chromosome 1p/19q status (Wang et al., 2018; 30713802). However, another analysis found that PD_L2 expression was not an independent predictor of prognosis in GBM (Takashima et al., 2018; 29721184). PDCD1LG2 amplification, which is often co_amplified with CD274, may lead to PD_L2 overexpression and predict sensitivity to PD_1, PD_L1, or PD_L2 antibodies.

H3F3A mutations affecting different hotspot residues, such as G35 (commonly referred to as G34 in the literature) and K28 (commonly known as K27), form different subgroups based on methylation and gene expression differences, the region of the brain affected, and clinical parameters (Sturm et al., 2012; 23079654). Recurrent mutations in the histone tail of H3F3A, at sites involved in critical post_translational modifications, have been reported at high frequency in pediatric and young adult brain tumors, including diffuse midline gliomas (Solomon et al., 2016; 26517431), diffuse hemispheric glioma (Fontebasso et al., 2013; 23417712), glioblastomas (Pandit et al., 2016; ISPNO Abstract HG_58)(Schwartzentruber et al., 2012; 22286061, Venneti et al., 2014; 25200322), aggressive pediatric gliomas (Wu et al., 2012; 22286216), pilocytic astrocytomas (Hochart et al., 2015; 25909089), gangliogliomas (Joyon et al., 2016; 27219822), glial and glioneuronal tumors (Nguyen et al., 2015; 25389051), as well as in low_grade gliomas undergoing transformation and secondary high_grade gliomas (Mistry et al., 2015; 25667294). These mutations were commonly found concurrently with mutations in TP53 or in ATRX and DAXX, which form a complex required for H3.3 recruitment to DNA, and were mutually exclusive with IDH1 mutations, which indirectly affect methylation of critical H3.3 residues (Schwartzentruber et al., 2012; 22286061). H3F3A K28M (also known as K27M) is a poor prognostic marker in glioma (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v2.2022).

H3F3A K28M mutation has also been identified in 58% of adult midline gliomas, and is associated with shorter OS for patients with brainstem gliomas but not for patients with thalamic gliomas (Feng et al., 2015; 26297251). Mutations of H3F3A or H3F3B, the other gene encoding histone H3.3, have also been detected in giant cell tumor of bone and chondroblastoma, with low mutation frequencies in other tumors of cartilage and bone (Behjati et al., 2013; 24162739, Kervarrec et al., 2017; 28059095, Righi et al., 2017; 28899740). H3F3B K37M (commonly known as K36M) has been identified in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, specifically in tumors of the oral cavity (Papillon_Cavanagh et al., 2017; 28067913). Overexpression of H3F3A is associated with poor survival in lung adenocarcinomas, and is thought to promote cancer cell invasion (Park et al., 2016; 27694942). Prospective data from pooled clinical studies and preclinical evidence suggest that H3F3A K28M mutation predicts benefit from the investigational selective dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) antagonist ONC201 (Chi et al., 2018; SNO abstract ACTR_34, Gardner et al., 2018; SNO abstract PDCT_06, Arrillaga_Romany et al., 2017; 29108308, Prabhu et al., 2018; 30559168), which is supported by increased expression of the ONC201 target DRD2 in H3F3A K28M_mutant versus wild_type gliomas (Chi et al, 2017; SNO abstract EXTH_42, Prabhu et al., 2018; 30559168). Among adult patients with recurrent H3F3A K28M_mutant gliomas, ONC201 achieved a DCR of 64% (7/11) and a 6_month PFS rate of 36% (5/14), with 3 patients experiencing complete and durable regressions of thalamic lesions (Chi et al., 2018; SNO abstract ACTR_34). Data from pooled ONC201 monotherapy trials showed that 31% (9/29) of patients with recurrent H3F3A K28M_mutated glioma remain progression free at 6.5 months median follow_up (Arrillaga et al., 2019; ASCO abstract 3005). Although other H3F3A mutations have been reported (Johnson et al., 2017; 28912153), it is unclear whether these therapeutic strategies would be relevant in gliomas with H3F3A mutations other than K28M. Patients with pediatric H3 K27_altered diffuse midline glioma may benefit from radiotherapy, either as a single modality or combined with alkylating agents (NCCN Pediatric Central Nervous Systems Cancers, v2.2023). H3F3A K27M mutation is characteristic of diffuse midline glioma, H3 K27M_altered (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v2.2022, NCCN Pediatric CNS Cancers Guidelines, v2.2023)(Louis et al., 2021; 34185076, Pfister et al., 2022; 34921008).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "JAK2", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "JAK2 encodes Janus kinase 2, a tyrosine kinase that regulates signals triggered by cytokines and growth factors (Jatiani et al., 2010; 21442038). JAK2 is often mutated in hematopoietic and lymphoid cancers. Cell lines and primary lymphoid cancer cells from a small number of patients with JAK2 amplification exhibit overabundance of JAK2 mRNA, protein, and phosphorylated JAK2 targets and respond to JAK2 inhibitors such as ruxolitinib similarly to JAK2_rearranged (activated) cell lines and primary blood cells from patients (Green et al., 2010; 20628145, Chase et al., 2013; 22875628). JAK2 alterations are very rare in glioma and glioblastoma (GBM); in the TCGA datasets JAK2 mutations were reported in 1% of cases analyzed (cBioPortal, Jun 2022)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). Several preclinical studies have demonstrated activity of JAK2/STAT3 inhibitors against GBM cells and mouse models, particularly in EGFR_mutant GBM (Mukthavaramet al., 2015; 26283544, Baskin et al., 2014; 25162558, Zheng et al., 2014; 24861878, He et al., 2013; 23838182, Stechishin et al., 2013; 23262510, Sai et al., 2012; 22249692). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of JAK2 alterations in glioma and GBM are limited (PubMed, Jun 2022). While JAK2 inhibitors have shown clinical benefit in hematological malignancies, clinical utility in solid tumors has not been demonstrated.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "MS_Stable", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "MS_Stable"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). Low_level MSI has been reported in 5_9% of glioblastoma (GBM) samples (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927, Martinez et al., 2005; 15672285, Martinez et al., 2007; 17498554). A large_scale study did not find high_level microsatellite instability (MSI_H) in any of 129 GBM samples (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927), although a small_scale study reported MSI_H in 4 of 15 pediatric GBMs and 1 of 12 adult GBMs (Szybka et al., 2003; 12908754). The frequency of MSI has been reported to be increased in relapsed compared to primary GBM (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927), in GBMs with a previous lower grade astrocytoma (Martinez et al., 2005; 15672285), and in giant cell GBM compared to classic GBM (Martinez et al., 2007; 17498554). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TP53", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "M1R", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"dnaFraction": "61.91", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "M1R"}}, "Interpretation": "Functional loss of the tumor suppressor p53, which is encoded by the TP53 gene, is common in aggressive advanced cancers (Brown et al., 2009; 19935675). Although alterations such as seen here have not been fully characterized and are of unknown functional significance, similar alterations have been previously reported in the context of cancer, which may indicate biological relevance. In the TCGA dataset, TP53 alterations have been reported in 35% of glioblastomas (GBMs), with a high incidence in pediatric and secondary GBMs and a low incidence in primary GBMs (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2008; 18772890, Jha et al., 2011; 22089350). One study detected TP53 alterations in 31% (73/232) of IDH_wildtype GBM samples analyzed, with most of the events being mutations (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). TP53 mutations have been reported in 18_40% of astrocytoma samples, and preferentially in anaplastic astrocytoma; one study reported TP53 loss of function and partially/fully functional mutations in 15% and 25% of anaplastic astrocytomas, respectively (Uno et al., 2005; 15914282, Uno et al., 2006; 16711514, Lass et al., 2012; 22844452, Faria et al., 2012; 23009112, Milinkovic et al., 2013; 24358143, Galatro et al., 2013; 23613880). Some studies suggest that the presence of a TP53 mutation is correlated with a favorable prognosis in patients with glioblastoma (GBM) (Schmidt et al., 2002; 11939587). One study reported that TP53 alterations were associated with poorer OS (12.9 months altered vs. 19.7 months wildtype, HR=1.58, p=0.0054) in IDH_wildtype GBM (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). Mutation of TP53 is thought to be an early step in the tumorigenesis of astrocytomas, which can progress into anaplastic astrocytoma and then glioblastoma through gain of other genetic abnormalities such as loss of CDKN2A or RB1, followed by loss of PTEN (Nozaki et al., 1999; 11550308). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633) or p53 gene therapy such as SGT53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628, Leung et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 4139). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% and SDs in 53% of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wildtype (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 32% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 43% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4_C trial for patients with TP53_ and RAS_mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as eprenetapopt. In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, eprenetapopt combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). A Phase 1 trial of eprenetapopt with pembrolizumab for patients with solid tumors reported an ORR of 10% (3/29) (Park et al., 2022; 36084396). It is not known whether these therapeutic approaches would be relevant in the context of alterations that have not been fully characterized, as seen here. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Mutation Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "00", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "00"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor mutation burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen. TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB below levels that would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Touat et al., 2020; 32322066, Kamiya_Matsuoka et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 393O, Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570, Johanns et al., 2016; 27683556, Lukas et al., 2018; 30073642). Glioblastoma (GBM) harbors a median TMB of 2.7 mutations per megabase (muts/Mb), and 4.2% of cases have high TMB (>20 muts/Mb)(FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). For pediatric patients, high TMB has been reported in a subset of high_grade gliomas, frequently in association with mutations in mismatch repair or proofreading genes and in TP53, whereas BRAF alterations or other oncogene fusions were observed more frequently in brain tumors harboring low TMB (Patel et al., 2020; 32386112, Johnson et al., 2017; 28912153). Increased TMB has been reported to correlate with higher tumor grade in glioma (Draaisma et al., 2015; 26699864) and glioblastoma (GBM) tissue samples with biallelic mismatch repair deficiency (bMMRD) (Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570), as well as with shorter OS of patients with diffuse glioma (Wang et al., 2020; 32164609). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In glioma, a lack of association between TMB and clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors has been reported (Kamiya_Matsuoka et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 393O, Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Touat et al., 2020; 32322066). However, multiple case studies have reported that patients with ultramutated gliomas driven by POLE mutations have benefited from treatment with anti_PD_1 (Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570, Johanns et al., 2016; 27683556) or anti_PD_L1 (Lukas et al., 2018; 30073642) therapies.
