[{"Name": "APC", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "R876*", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"dnaFraction": "39.64", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "R876*"}}, "Interpretation": "APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) encodes a tumor suppressor with critical roles in regulating cell division and adhesion. APC interacts with beta_catenin and controls signaling in the WNT pathway, which regulates embryonic development and cell differentiation (Logan and Nusse, 2004; 15473860). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt APC function or expression (Eklof et al., 2001; 11707392, Liu et al., 2006; 16753179, Dikovskaya et al., 2010; 20144988, Murphy et al., 2007; 17410430, Aretz et al., 2004; 15459959). APC mutations and homozygous deletions were observed in 0.6%_6.7% and 0.6%_4.5% of prostate adenocarcinoma cases, respectively (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2015; 26544944, cBio_Fraser et al., 2017; 28068672, cBio_Robinson et al., 2015; 26000489, cBio_Abida et al., 2019; 31061129). APC methylation has been frequently observed in prostate carcinoma (Liu et al., 2011; 21207416, Yoon et al., 2012; 22511308, Trock et al., 2012; 22077694), and dysregulation of the WNT signaling pathway is believed to play a role in a subset of prostate cancers (Gerstein et al., 2002; 11921277, Yardy et al., 2009; 18514389). In prostate cancer, APC promoter hypermethylation is associated with shorter time to relapse in both univariate (P = 0.002) and multivariate analyses (Henrique et al., 2007; 17947477). Solid tumors with WNT/beta_catenin pathway alterations, as seen here, were observed to have significantly less T_cell inflammation in one study (Luke et al., 2019; 30635339). There are no approved drugs targeting APC inactivation in cancer. Loss of APC function leads to accumulation of beta_catenin and upregulation of WNT pathway transcription programs (Zhan et al., 2017; 27617575), and potential therapeutic approaches to target this pathway include CBP/beta_catenin antagonists, which interfere with the ability of beta_catenin to interact with transcriptional co_activator CBP (Jung et al., 2020; 32037398, Krishnamurthy and Kurzrock, 2018; 29169144). In a Phase 1 trial of the CBP/beta_catenin antagonist E7386, 1 patient with APC_mutated small bowel adenocarcinoma achieved a PR with tumor shrinkage of _69% and response duration of 165 days (Kawazoe et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 473P); preclinical data support sensitivity of APC_deficient gastric or colorectal cancer models to E7386 (Yamada et al., 2021; 33408116, Kanda et al., 2022; 34837838). One or more of the APC variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (ClinVar, Apr 2023)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in APC are found in more than 90% of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) (Kerr et al., 2013; 23159591, Fearon, 2011; 21090969, Kastritis et al., 2009; 18844223). The prevalence for FAP in the general population is estimated to be 1:8,300 from birth (Half et al., 2009; 19822006), and in the appropriate clinical context germline testing of APC is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Based on preclinical and limited clinical data, APC inactivation may be associated with sensitivity to CBP/beta_catenin interaction inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04008797", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03264664", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "BARD1", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "R406*", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"dnaFraction": "40.36", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "R406*"}}, "Interpretation": "BARD1 encodes the BRCA1_associated RING domain 1 protein, which is required for stabilization and nuclear localization of BRCA1 as well as formation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase (Irminger_Finger, 2010; 19959210). The BARD1 ANK repeats and BRCT motifs play important roles in chromosome stability, and both these regions and the RING domain are necessary for homology_directed repair (Laufer et al., 2007; 17848578, Wu et al., 2015; 25634209, Westermark et al., 2003; 14560035). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt BARD1 function or expression. BARD1 mutations have been reported in 0_2% of prostate adenocarcinoma samples (cBio_Baca et al., 2013; 23622249, cBio_Barbieri et al., 2012; 22610119, cBio_Taylor et al., 2010; 20579941, cBio_Grasso et al., 2012; 22722839). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of BARD1 alterations in prostate carcinoma are limited (PubMed, Mar 2023). Clinical benefit from rucaparib has been observed in a patient with BARD1_mutated ovarian cancer (O Malley et al., 2017; AACR_NCI_EORTC Abstract LB_A12). On the basis of preclinical evidence, tumors with BARD1 inactivation may be sensitive to PARP inhibitors (Wu et al., 2015; 25634209, Wang et al., 2016; 27454289, Ozden et al., 2016; 27197561, Nguyen et al., 2017; AACR Abstract 2476, Zhao et al., 2017; 28976962).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Tumors with BARD1 inactivating mutation or loss may be sensitive to PARP inhibitors.", "Therapies": {"Therapy": [{"Name": null, "GenericName": "Talazoparib", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> The PARP inhibitor talazoparib is FDA approved to treat HER2_negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA mutations.

An exome sequencing study of aggressive and non_aggressive prostate cancer cases reported that patients with pathogenic, likely pathogenic, or deleterious BRCA2 mutations had statistically higher odds of aggressive disease (4.3_fold), prostate cancer death (4.7_fold), and metastatic disease (5.7_fold)(Darst et al., 2022; AACR Abstract 688). In another study, germline BRCA2 mutation carriers had a significantly shorter cause_specific survival (CSS, 8.6 vs. 15.7 years) than noncarriers (Castro et al., 2013; 23569316).

Patients with germline or somatic BRCA2 mutations have been reported to experience significantly shorter time to castration_resistant disease progression on first_line abiraterone or enzalutamide treatment (9.4 vs. 18.4 months, HR=1.58) and significantly shorter OS (16.9 vs. 21.8 months, HR=1.64) (Warner et al., 2021; 33414135). For patients with metastatic castration_resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), germline BRCA2 mutations were an independent marker of poor prognosis (CSS 17.4 vs. 33.2 months, HR=2.11) in 1 study (Castro et al., 2019; 30625039). Alterations that inactivate BRCA1 or BRCA2 may confer sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Kaufman et al., 2015; 25366685, Mateo et al., 2015; 26510020, Tutt et al., 2010; 20609467, Robson et al., 2017; 28578601, Mirza et al., 2016; 27717299, Sandhu et al., 2013; 23810788, Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594, Drew et al., 2016; 27002934, Pujade_Lauraine et al., 2017; 28754483, Ledermann et al., 2016; 27617661, Fong et al., 2009; 19553641, Audeh et al., 2010; 20609468, Fong et al., 2010; 20406929, Gelmon et al., 2011; 21862407, Kaye et al., 2012; 22203755, Domchek et al., 2016; 26723501, Moore et al., 2018; 30345884, Golan et al., 2019; 31157963) or ATR inhibitors (Yap et al., 2020; 32988960, Thomas et al., 2018; 29252124, O Carrigan et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2504, Yap et al., 2016; AACR_NCI_EORTC Abstract 1LBA, Saito et al., 2018; 31299005). Clinical responses to PARP inhibitors have been reported for patients with either germline or somatic BRCA1/2 mutations (Mateo et al., 2015; 26510020, Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594, Ledermann et al., 2016; 27617661, Moore et al., 2018; 30345884, Golan et al., 2019; 31157963) and for patients with platinum_resistant or _refractory disease (Fong et al., 2010; 20406929, Kaufman et al., 2015; 25366685, Sandhu et al., 2013; 23810788, Domchek et al., 2016; 26723501). The WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib has been evaluated as a monotherapy and in combination with PARP_inhibitor, olaparib. In a Phase 2 study for patients with PARP_resistant ovarian cancer, the combination of olaparib and adavosertib elicited improved clinical benefit (ORR: 29%; DCR: 89%) compared to adavosertib alone (ORR: 23%; DCR: 63%); however, in the BRCA_mutated cohort, no significant difference in clinical benefit was observed between the combination (ORR: 19%) and monotherapy (ORR: 20%) treatments (Westin et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 5505). In a Phase 1 monotherapy trial of adavosertib that included 9 patients with BRCA1/2_mutated solid tumors, 2 patients with BRCA1_mutated cancers (1 with ovarian serous carcinoma and 1 with oral squamous cell carcinoma) achieved PRs, and a third patient with ovarian serous carcinoma harboring mutations in BRCA1 and TP53 experienced 14% tumor shrinkage prior to disease progression (Do et al., 2015; 25964244). In a case study, a patient with therapy_induced neuroendocrine prostate cancer and an inactivating BRCA2 rearrangement experienced a CR ongoing for 20 months to the ATR inhibitor berzosertib (Saito et al., 2018; 31299005). Preclinical studies of BRCA1/2 inactivation in T_cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T_ALL) (Pouliot et al., 2019; 31721781), ovarian carcinoma (Kim et al., 2017; 27993965), and triple_negative breast cancer (TNBC) (Jin et al., 2018; 29605721) showing reduced cell viability and increased DNA damage during ATR treatment further support the sensitivity of BRCA2_deficient cells to ATR inhibitors. The Phase 3 PROfound study for patients with metastatic castration_resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) who had progressed on a new hormonal agent reported improved radiographic PFS with olaparib compared with physician s choice of abiraterone/prednisone or enzalutamide for patients with BRCA1/2 or ATM alterations (7.4 vs. 3.6 mo., HR=0.34) (Hussain et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract LBA12PR). The Phase 1/2 PETRA study of PARP1 inhibitor AZD5305 observed a 25% (10/40) ORR (10 PR), for patients with BRCA1/2, PALB2, or RAD51C_mutated breast, ovarian, pancreatic, or prostate cancer, including 5 patients with prior PARP inhibitor treatment (Yap et al., 2022; AACR Abstract CT007). Alterations in DNA repair genes such as BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PALB2, FANCA, RAD51D, CHEK2, and CDK12 have been reported to be predictive for sensitivity to platinum agents in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) (NCCN Prostate Cancer Guidelines, v1.2023) (Cheng et al., 2015; 26724258, Imyanitov et al., 2011; 21819606, Mota et al., 2020; 32856010, Pomerantz et al., 2017; 28608931). Clinical data from small retrospective studies (Vlachostergios et al., 2019; AACR Abstract 4865, Priv\u00e9 et al., 2021; 34253846) and case reports (Crumbaker et al., 2019; 35100671, Satapathy et al., 2021; 33630794, Kratochwil et al., 2020; 31601699, Ahmadzadehfar et al., 2018; 29762244, De Giorgi et al., 2021; 34333554) are conflicting as to whether alterations in DNA repair genes such as BRCA1, BRCA2, and ATM are associated with outcomes for patients with CRPC treated with PSMA_targeted radionuclide_based therapies such as lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan (177Lu_PSMA_617). Germline BRCA2 mutations in mCRPC were associated with relative benefit from first_line abiraterone or enzalutamide compared with taxanes (CSS 24.0 vs. 17.0 months, PFS on the second systemic therapy 18.9 vs. 8.6 months) in a large prospective cohort study (Castro et al., 2019; 30625039). Three patients with non_neuroendocrine prostate cancer harboring BRCA2 mutations derived clinical benefit from treatment with platinum_based chemotherapy (Cheng et al., 2015; 26724258, Bryant et al., 2015; 26708042). Inactivation of BRCA2 may also predict sensitivity to DNA_damaging drugs such as trabectedin, lurbinectedin, and the platinum chemotherapies cisplatin and carboplatin (Isakoff et al., 2015; 25847936, Dann et al., 2012; 22406760, Evers et al., 2008; 18559613, Soares et al., 2007; 17656556, Miolo et al., 2016; 27561088, Ghouadni et al., 2017; 28467918, Tedesco et al., 2011; ASCO Abstract 1125, Perez et al., 2017; 28626402, Monk et al., 2020; 31924332, Harnicek et al., 2016; 26933761, Cruz et al., 2018; 30240327, Awada et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 1072, Poveda et al., 2017; 28368437). One or more of the BRCA2 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (ClinVar, Apr 2023)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Inactivating germline mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 are associated with autosomal dominant hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (Miki et al., 1994; 7545954, Wooster et al., 1995; 8524414), and the lifetime risk of breast and ovarian cancer in BRCA2 mutation carriers has been estimated to be as high as >80% and 23%, respectively (King et al., 2003; 14576434). Elevated risk for other cancer types, including gastric, pancreatic, prostate, and colorectal, has also been identified, with an increase in risk ranging from 20 to 60% (Friedenson, 2005; 16369438). The estimated prevalence of deleterious germline BRCA1/2 mutations in the general population is between 1:400 and 1:800, with an approximately 10_fold higher prevalence in the Ashkenazi Jewish population (Ford et al., 1994; 7907678, Whittemore et al., 1997; 9042908, Claus et al., 1996; 8635102, Struewing et al., 1997; 9145676, Oddoux et al., 1996; 8841192, King et al., 2003; 14576434, Hall et al., 2009; 19241424).

Alterations such as seen here may disrupt CDK12 function or expression (Bosken et al., 2014; 24662513, Dixon_Clarke et al., 2015; 26597175, Ekumi et al., 2015; 25712099, Zhang et al., 2019; 30617155). CDK12 mutation has been reported in 4.3_6.9% of patients with metastatic castration_resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) (Rescigno et al., 2021; 32988971, Graf et al., 2021; 34716049, Wu et al., 2018; 29906450, Nguyen et al., 2020; 32317181). The frequency of CDK12 mutations has been reported to be higher in mCRPC than in primary prostate cancer, where CDK12 mutations have been observed in 1.2% of patients (Wu et al., 2018; 29906450). Retrospective analyses of prostate cancer have found that CDK12 alterations are associated with high_risk features, including high Gleason scores and de novo metastases, with most patients developing CRPC (Antonarakis et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1200/PO.19.00399, Schweizer et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1200/PO.19.00383, Nguyen et al., 2020; 32317181, Reimers et al., 2019; 31640893, Rescigno et al., 2021; 32988971). Retrospective analyses of prostate cancer found that among patients presenting with localized disease, CDK12 mutation was associated with shorter time to metastasis (34.9 vs. 55.6_64.7 months, HR=0.46_0.59) and earlier development of CRPC (32.7 vs. 56.2_72.8 months, HR=0.42_0.51) compared with the non_CDK12 study cohorts (Reimers et al., 2019; 31640893); another retrospective analysis reported that patients with CDK12 alterations experienced earlier development of CRPC prostate_specific antigen PFS on first_line abiraterone or enzalutamide treatment (Warner et al., 2021; 33414135). Additional studies report that CDK12 alteration or biallelic loss is associated with shorter OS (64.4 vs. 74.9 months, HR=1.70 and 61.2 vs. 76.8 months, HR=1.65, respectively) (Nguyen et al., 2020; 32317181, Rescigno et al., 2021; 32988971). A study of 59 patients with hormone_sensitive prostate cancer identified MSH2, CDK12, RB1, and TP53 alterations as independent risk factors for early progression to castration_resistant prostate cancer (Wang et al., 2022; 36401126). CDK12 inactivation in cancer is associated with genomic instability characterized by tandem duplications (Popova et al., 2016; 26787835, Wu et al., 2018; 29906450, Viswanathan et al., 2018; 29909985, Menghi et al., 2018; 30017478, Sokol et al., 2019; 31292271) and has been shown to increase tumor immunogenicity in advanced prostate cancer (Wu et al., 2018; 29906450). On the basis of clinical and preclinical evidence in prostate cancer, CDK12 inactivation may predict benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors (Wu et al., 2018; 29906450, Antonarakis et al., 2020; 32462107, Schweizer et al., 2020; 32671317). Retrospective studies observed prostate_specific antigen (PSA) response rates of 11_50% (2/19_2/4) for patients with CDK12_mutated metastatic prostate cancer on immune checkpoint inhibitors (predominantly anti_PD_1 monotherapy)(Schweizer et al., 2020; 32671317, Antonarakis et al., 2020; 32462107, Reimers et al., 2019; 31640893, Wu et al., 2018; 29906450). The prospective NEPTUNES trial of nivolumab plus ipilimumab reported a composite response rate of 14% (1/7) in CDK12_mutated metastatic castration_resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), with the responder also having high tumor_infiltrating lymphocytes (Linch et al., 2021; AACR Abstract LB004). In a similar treatment population, the prospective IMPACT trial for patients with CDK12_inactivated mCRPC reported PSA \u226550% decline in 14% (4/28) of patients and unconfirmed PSA \u226530% decline in 21% (6/28) of patients following treatment with nivolumab plus ipilimumab (Alva et al., 2022; ASCO GU Abstract 103). Preclinical data suggest CDK12 inactivating alterations may sensitize cells to PARP inhibitors (Joshi et al., 2014; 24554720, Natrajan et al., 2014; 24395524, Bajrami et al., 2014; 24240700, Ekumi et al., 2015; 25712099, Johnson et al., 2016; 27880910, AlHilli et al., 2016; 27614696), and the Phase 3 PROfound study reported numerically improved PFS for patients with CDK12_altered tumors treated with olaparib compared to control androgen deprivation therapy (5.1 vs. 2.2 months) (de Bono et al., 2020; 32343890). However, multiple clinical studies have observed no radiographic responses for patients with CDK12_altered CRPC treated with PARP inhibitors (Mateo et al., 2020; 31806540, Abida et al., 2020; 32086346, Antonarakis et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1200/PO.19.00399). Cells lacking CDK12 incur spontaneous DNA damage and exhibit heightened sensitivity to DNA_damaging agents (Joshi et al., 2014; 24554720, Natrajan et al., 2014; 24395524, Bajrami et al., 2014; 24240700, Ekumi et al., 2015; 25712099; Johnson et al., 2016; 27880910, AlHilli et al., 2016; 27614696). Alterations in DNA repair genes such as BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PALB2, FANCA, RAD51D, CHEK2, and CDK12 have been reported to be predictive for sensitivity to platinum agents in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) (NCCN Prostate Cancer Guidelines, v1.2023) (Cheng et al., 2015; 26724258, Imyanitov et al., 2011; 21819606, Mota et al., 2020; 32856010, Pomerantz et al., 2017; 28608931). Studies on the impact of CDK12 alterations on response to taxanes for patients with metastatic castration_resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) are conflicting (NCCN Prostate Cancer Guidelines, v1.2023) (Antonarakis et al., 2020; 32462107, Dong et al., 2021; 33990090).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Preclinical and clinical data suggest that tumors with CDK12 mutation or loss may be sensitive to PARP inhibitors.

An association between higher TMB and improved OS, median PFS, and ORR has been observed in large pan_solid tumor studies for patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386). </p> <p><b>Supporting Data:</b> Clinical data on the efficacy of cemiplimab for the treatment of prostate carcinoma are limited (PubMed, Mar 2023).

In more than half of cancers, the ATM/CHK2/p53 pathway is compromised, and the ATR/CHK1/CDC25 pathway provides cell_cycle arrest needed for repair of DNA damage (Goto et al., 2012; 22435685). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt CHEK1 function or expression (Capasso et al., 2002; 12415000, Zhao and Piwnica_Worms, 2001; 11390642, Ng et al., 2003; 14681223, Gong et al., 2018; 30510197). CHEK1 mutations have been generally observed at low frequencies in cancer, with greatest prevalence in non_melanoma skin cancer (2.7%), endometrial cancer (1.8%), and melanoma (1.4%) (Zehir et al., 2017; 28481359). CHEK1 expression was reported to be higher in TNBC and basal_like breast cancer as compared with benign lesions and other types of malignant breast cancer (Albiges et al., 2014; 24636978, Lee et al., 2017; 28138032). One study found that CHEK1 was the most upregulated kinase in glioblastoma and was overexpressed in all subtypes compared with healthy cells or to low_grade glioma (Bai et al., 2018; 29287241). However, CHEK1 deletion or methylation was detected more frequently in cervical carcinoma than in premalignant cervical lesions (80% vs. 35%, respectively), and CHEK1 expression was also reduced in these cells as compared with normal cervical tissues (Mazumder et al., 2011; 21154811). CHEK1 alterations have been associated with reduced survival for patients with cervical cancer (Mazumder et al., 2011; 21154811). High CHEK1 expression or phosphorylation correlated with aggressive phenotypes and a poorer prognosis in glioma, breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and non_small cell lung cancer (Bai et al., 2018; 29287241, Grabauskiene et al., 2014; 24418519, Abdel_Fatah et al., 2015; 25468710, Bryant et al. 2014; 25104095, Xie et al., 2014; 24464213).

In response to signals from the environment, EGFR passes biochemical messages to the cell that stimulate it to grow and divide (Ciardiello and Tortora, 2008; 18337605). The G724S mutation seen here has been characterized as activating (Cho et al., 2014; 24894453) and confers resistance to first_generation EGFR inhibitors in the context of co_occurring activating EGFR alterations (Li et al., 2018; 29502892, Lu et al., 2019; 30610926, De Wit et al., 2020; 32512509, Wei et al., 2021; 34590038, Yu et al., 2021; 34396638). In the context of co_occurring EGFR exon 19 deletions, G724S has demonstrated resistance to osimertinib (Oztan et al., 2017; 28838405, Le et al., 2018; 30228210, Fassunke et al., 2019; 30405134, Cortiula et al., 2019; 30788361, Zhang et al., 2018; 30588029, Peled et al., 2017; 28286242). Limited preclinical evidence for resistance to erlotinib (Brown et al., 2019; 30796031), gefitinib (Fassunke et al., 2019; 30405134), and osimertinib (Fassunke et al., 2019; 30405134) has also been reported for G724S alone. EGFR mutation and amplification have been observed in 6.6% and 0.7_4.1% of prostate carcinoma cases, respectively (cBioPortal, COSMIC, Dec 2022)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210, Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). Many studies have reported EGFR overexpression in prostate cancer, cited in 25_42% of cases (de Muga et al., 2010; 20208477, Peraldo_Neia et al., 2011; 21266046, Baek et al., 2012; 22500161, Weber et al., 2012; 22546016, Carlsson et al., 2013; 23255921). One study reports no significant correlation between EGFR expression and PSA levels (Weber et al., 2012; 22546016). Higher levels of EGFR have been correlated with poor prognosis and higher Gleason score in prostate cancer patients (Weber et al., 2012; 22546016, Peraldo_Neia et al., 2011; 21266046). For patients with non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), EGFR activating mutations may predict sensitivity to EGFR\u2013TKIs, including erlotinib (Rosell et al., 2011; 22285168), gefitinib (Douillard et al., 2014; 24263064, Hayashi et al., 2020; 32673682, Cao et al., 2018; 29780256, Yang et al., 2011; 21422421), afatinib (Sequist et al., 2013; 23816960, Bao_Dong Qin et al., 2018; 30127622, Frega et al., 2016; 27131295, Long et al., 2020; 33116645), dacomitinib (Mok et al., 2018; 29864379), and osimertinib (Janne et al., 2015; 25923549, Bao_Dong Qin et al., 2018; 30127622); however, the data for patients with other tumor types are limited (Hong et al., 2020; 32749686, Kim et al., 2015; 26462025, Kim et al., 2015; 25424851, Mondal et al., 2020; 32303840, Cavalieri et al., 2018; 29734047, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886, Audet et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 6041). EGFR G724S mediates resistance to osimertinib; notably, virtually all reported evidence for clinical and preclinical resistance of G724S to this agent has been in the context of co_occurrence with activating exon 19 deletions (Oztan et al., 2017; 28838405, Le et al., 2018; 30228210, Fassunke et al., 2019; 30405134, Cortiula et al., 2019; 30788361, Zhang et al., 2018; 30588029, Peled et al., 2017; 2828624, Brown et al., 2019; 30796031, Tan et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 11506) irrespective of the presence of T790M (Oztan et al., 2017; 28838405, Le et al., 2018; 30228210, Fassunke et al., 2019; 30405134, Cortiula et al., 2019; 30788361, Zhang et al., 2018; 30588029, Peled et al., 2017; 28286242). G724S co_occurring with other activating alterations is rare (Brown et al., 2019; 30796031), and, therefore, it is unclear whether EGFR G724S would reduce sensitivity to osimertinib outside of EGFR exon 19 deletions. G724S also reduces resistance to first_generation EGFR inhibitors, with a retrospective analysis reporting emergence of G724S in 4 patients with non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who progressed on erlotinib or gefitinib; 3 harbored concurrent activating exon 19 deletions and 1 harbored a concurrent L861G activating mutation (Li et al., 2018; 29502892). However, in other studies, 2 additional patients, 1 with concurrent S768I activating mutation, experienced SD to these inhibitors (Cheng et al., 2015; 26354324, Ogino et al., 2005; 16166444).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "EGFR activating mutations, rearrangements, or amplification may predict sensitivity to EGFR_targeted therapies.

The activity of this complex is essential to prevention of chromosome breakage caused by DNA damage (Pace et al., 2002; 12093742). Germline mutations in FANCL cause Fanconi anemia, a clinically heterogeneous disorder involving various developmental abnormalities as well as predisposition to cancer; underlying these phenotypes are defects in DNA repair (Deakyne and Mazin, 2011; 21568838). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt FANCL function or expression (Alpi et al., 2007; 17938197, Alpi et al., 2008; 19111657, Meetei et al., 2003; 12973351, Machida et al., 2006; 16916645, Hodson et al., 2011; 21775430, Hodson et al., 2013; 24389026, Hodson et al., 2014; 24389026, Seki et al., 2007; 17352736, Ali et al., 2008; 19405097).

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample has a high level of MSI, equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSI_high (MSI_H) tumor: one with mutations in >30% of microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSI_H status indicates high_level deficiency in MMR and typically correlates with loss of expression of at least one, and often two, MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSI has been reported in 3.1_14.6% of prostate cancer samples (Hall et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 1523, Cheng et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 251)(Pritchard et al., 2014; 25255306, Schwarzenbach et al., 2008; 18336598, Suzuki et al., 1995; 7493915). A study of prostate cancer in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) families reported MSI_H in 4_50% of cases (Dominguez_Valentin et al., 2016; 27013479, Rosty et al., 2014; 25117503, Ahman et al., 2001; 11251526). For patients with advanced prostate cancer, dMMR/MSI status was associated with shorter median OS compared with patients with proficient MMR (3.8 vs. 7.0 years) by univariate and multivariate analysis (adjusted HR=4.09; P=0.005)(Rodrigues et al., 2018; 30382943). On the basis of clinical evidence in multiple solid tumor types, microsatellite instability (MSI) and associated increased tumor mutational burden (TMB) (Jass, 2007; 17204026, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894) may predict sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors, including the approved PD_1_targeting agents cemiplimab, dostarlimab, nivolumab (alone or in combination with ipilimumab), retifanlimab, and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2017; 28734759, Overman et al., 2018; 29355075, Overman et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 635, Shitara et al., 2022; 35322232, Andre et al., 2022; ASCO GI Abstract 244, Lipson et al., 2013; 23169436, Le et al., 2015; 26028255, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070, Oaknin et al., 2020; 33001143, Berton et al., 2021; SITC Abstract 956), as well as PD_L1_targeting agents atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab (alone or in combination with tremelimumab) (Hochster et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 673, Fleming et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 5585, Bang et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 92, Pietrantonio et al., 2023; ASCO GI Abstract 358, Lee et al., 2023; ASCO GI abstract 401, Rubinstein et al., 2022; 36512912, Marie et al., 2021; 33811152). While approximately 80% of MSI_H tumors arise due to somatic inactivation of an MMR pathway protein, about 20% arise due to germline mutations in one of the MMR genes (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942), which are associated with a condition known as Lynch syndrome (also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or HNPCC) (Lynch et al., 2009; 19659756). Lynch syndrome leads to an increased risk of colorectal, endometrial, gastric, and other cancers (Lynch et al., 2009; 19659756, Pande et al., 2012; 22714864, Kastrinos and Syngal, 2007; 17920897) and has an estimated prevalence in the general population ranging from 1:600 to 1:2000 (Silva et al., 2009; 19466295, Sehgal et al., 2014; 24978665, de la Chapelle et al., 2005; 16136383).

The PI3K pathway is involved in cell signaling that regulates a number of critical cellular functions, including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, motility, and survival (Samuels et al., 2005; 15950905, Engelman, 2009; 19629070). PIK3CA alterations that have been characterized as activating, such as observed here, are predicted to be oncogenic (Kang et al., 2005; 15647370, Ikenoue et al., 2005; 15930273, Gymnopoulos et al., 2007; 17376864, Horn et al., 2008; 18317450, Rudd et al., 2011; 21266528, Hon et al., 2012; 22120714, Burke et al., 2012; 22949682, Wu et al., 2009; 19915146, Dbouk et al., 2010; 2103068, Dan et al., 2010; 20530683, Oda et al., 2008; 18829572, Zhao and Vogt, 2008; 18794883, Lui et al., 2013; 23619167, Ross et al., 2013; 22430209, Riviere et al., 2012; 22729224, Shibata et al., 2009; 19394761, Droguluk et al., 2015; 26627007, Croessmann et al., 2018; 29284706, Ng et al., 2018; 29533785, Spangle et al., 2020; 32929011, Chen et al., 2018; 29636477, Jin et al., 2021; 34779417). PIK3CA mutations have been reported in up to 4.3% of prostate adenocarcinomas (cBio_Barbieri et al., 2012; 22610119, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2015; 26544944, cBio_Taylor et al., 2010; 20579941, cBio_Stopsack et al., 2020; 32220891). PI3K pathway dysregulation in prostate cancer has been reported in numerous studies, noting either PIK3CA mutation, amplification, or overexpression, or PTEN deletion (Sun et al., 2009; 19443396, Agell et al., 2011; 21113138, Beltran et al., 2013; 22981675). Retrospective analysis of the Prostate Adenocarcinoma TCGA dataset showed a significant association between PIK3CA alteration, including amplification, with decreased survival (HR=0.55), increased regional lymph node metastasis, higher primary tumor category, and higher Gleason grade (Pearson et al., 2018; 29581176). Clinical and preclinical data in various tumor types indicate that PIK3CA activating alterations may predict sensitivity to therapies targeting PI3K (Fritsch et al., 2014; 24608574, Juric et al., 2018; 29401002, Gallant et al., 2019; 30793038, Canaud et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract LBA23, Delestre et al., 2021; 34613809, Morschhauser et al., 2020; 31619463, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108, Santin et al., 2020; 31934607, Damodaran et al., 2022; 35133871), AKT (Andre et al., 2019; 31091374, Smyth et al., 2021; 33863913), or mTOR (Varnier et al., 2019; 31351267, Basse et al., 2018; 32914004, Sultova et al., 2021; 33277683, Mackay et al., 2014; 24166148, Myers et al., 2016; 27016228, Dhami et al., 2018; 29588307, Harris et al., 2019; 30863722, Hanna et al., 2018; 29301825). The Phase 2 NCI_MATCH study of copanlisib for patients with refractory solid tumors harboring PIK3CA mutations with or without PTEN loss met its primary endpoint with an ORR of 16% (4/25 PRs); responses (PR or SD >6 months) were seen in patients with ameloblastoma, liposarcoma, and carcinomas of the endometrium, ovary, esophagus, lung, and prostate (Damodaran et al., 2022; 35133871). However, the Phase 2 study of copanlisib for patients with endometrial carcinoma harboring PIK3CA hotspot mutations failed to report any objective responses (n=11)(Santin et al., 2020; 31934607). Two other studies of copanlisib for patients with genomically unselected tumors reported 1 CR and 2 PRs (1 unconfirmed) among 16 total patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors with or without PTEN alterations (Morschhauser et al., 2020; 31619463, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108). In the Phase 2 MATCH trial for patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors, 28% (18/65) of patients experienced PFS lasting at least 6 months after treatment with taselisib; however, no ORs were observed in this study (Krop et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 101). A separate Phase 1b study of taselisib in combination with the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib for patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors reported an ORR of 0% (n=12) and a DCR of 17% (2/12) (Pascual et al., 2021; 32958578). In a Phase 1 trial of the dual PI3K/mTOR kinase inhibitor apitolisib, 79% (11/14) of patients with PIK3CA_mutated advanced solid tumors experienced disease control (3 PRs, 8 SDs) (Dolly et al., 2016; 26787751). The PI3K inhibitor alpelisib is approved as a single agent for the treatment of patients with PIK3CA_related overgrowth spectrum (PROS) (Canaud et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract LBA23), but has shown limited activity as monotherapy for PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors with a Phase 1a study reporting an ORR of 6.0% (8/134) and a DCR of 58% (78/134) (Juric et al., 2018; 29401002).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "PIK3CA activating mutations may lead to activation of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway and may therefore indicate sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway.

Reduction or loss of PTEN protein expression has been found in 18_61% of prostate cancer cases and has been found to be associated with more advanced stage, more rapid progression to metastasis, and reduced patient survival (Lotan et al., 2011; 21878536, Reid et al., 2010; 20104229, Antonarakis et al., 2012; 22674438, Zu et al., 2013; 23983239, Cuzick et al., 2013; 23695019). Concurrent alterations in at least 2 of the TP53, RB1, and PTEN genes, as seen in this sample, molecularly define a subtype of prostate cancer with aggressive clinical course and reduced sensitivity to androgen_deprivation therapies (NCCN Prostate Cancer Guidelines, v1.2023)(Corn et al., 2019; 31515154, Tsaur et al., 2019; 30875581, Spetsieris et al., 2020; 33339136, Aparicio et al., 2013; 23649003, Aparicio et al., 2015; 26546618, Koczka et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 193, Aparicio et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5052). PTEN loss or mutation leads to activation of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway and may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway (Courtney et al., 2010; 20085938, Simpson and Parsons, 2001; 11237521, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108, Milella et al., 2017; 28220839). The Phase 3 IPATential150 trial combining either ipatasertib or placebo with abiraterone and prednisolone for patients with no prior treatment for metastatic castration_resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) reported superior radiographic PFS (18.5 vs. 16.5 months, HR=0.77) and ORR (61% vs. 39%) with ipatasertib for patients with PTEN loss as determined by immunohistochemistry (Sweeney et al., 2021; 34246347, de Bono et al., 2021; ASCO GU Abstract 13). A Phase 2 study combining either ipatasertib or placebo with abiraterone and prednisolone for metastatic CRPC reported improved radiographic PFS from the addition of ipatasertib for patients with PTEN loss (11.5 vs. 4.6 months, HR=0.39), but limited benefit for those without PTEN loss (7.5 vs. 5.6 months, HR=0.84) (de Bono et al., 2019; 30037818). A Phase 2 trial combining either the AKT inhibitor capivasertib or placebo with docetaxel and prednisolone for patients with metastatic CRPC reported prolonged OS (31.2 vs. 20.3 months, HR=0.54) with the addition of capivasertib but comparable composite PFS (7.0 vs. 6.7 months, HR= 0.92) between trial arms; OS and PFS were consistent irrespective of PTEN, PI3K, or AKT status (Crabb et al., 2021; 33326257). Multiple studies of mTOR inhibitors including everolimus and temsirolimus have been terminated due to limited efficacy, reporting brief PFS (1.9_3.6 months) (George et al., 2019; 31522863, Eule et al., 2022; 36402814, Templeton et al., 2013; 23582881, Koshkin et al., 2019; 31037562, Armstrong et al., 2013; 23830964). Preclinical data indicate that PTEN loss or inactivation may predict sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Mendes_Pereira et al., 2009; 20049735, Shen et al., 2013; 23881923, Chatterjee et al., 2013; 23565244, McCormick et al., 2016; 26905328, Forster et al., 2011; 21468130), and clinical benefit has been observed for patients with PTEN_altered breast cancer including triple negative breast cancer (Gruber et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 3006, Eikesdal et al., 2021; 33242536), ovarian cancer (Dougherty et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 5536), uterine leiomyosarcoma (Pan et al., 2021; 33970096), and endometrial cancer (Forster et al., 2011; 21468130) treated with PARP inhibitors. However, some studies have reported a lack of association between PTEN mutation and PARP inhibitor sensitivity (Sandhu et al., 2013; 23810788, Romero et al., 2020; 32988624, Piha_Paul et al., 2018; AACR Abstract A096). In post_hoc analyses of a Phase 1/2 trial, the addition of carboplatin to cabazitaxel significantly improved PFS (6.0 vs. 2.2 months) and OS (17.4 vs. 9.9 months) for patients with an aggressive variant prostate cancer molecular signature (AVPC_MS, composed of alterations in at least 2 of the genes RB1, TP53, and PTEN); no significant difference in outcomes were observed for patients lacking this signature (NCCN Prostate Cancer Guidelines, v1.2023)(Corn et al., 2019; 31515154). Post_hoc analysis of a Phase 2 trial in metastatic castration_resistant prostate cancer suggests that patients with aggressive variant prostate cancer (AVPC), molecularly characterized by harboring alterations in at least 2 genes of TP53, RB1, and PTEN, as seen in this sample, may benefit from cabazitaxel combined with carboplatin compared with cabazitaxel alone (median PFS of 5.1 vs. 2.2 months, p=0.03; estimated median OS of 11.2 vs. 10.5 months, p=0.11), whereas patients who were AVPC_negative did not benefit from the more intense chemotherapy combination in this study (Corn et al., 2019; 31515154). One or more of the PTEN variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with hamartoma tumor syndrome (ClinVar, Apr 2023)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. PTEN mutations underlie several inherited disorders, collectively termed PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS), which include Cowden syndrome (CS) and its variant Lhermitte_Duclos disease (LD), Bannayan_Riley_Ruvalcaba syndrome (BRRS), PTEN_related Proteus syndrome (PS), and Proteus_like syndrome (Blumenthal and Dennis, 2008; 18781191, Orloff and Eng, 2008; 18794875). The mutation rate for PTEN in these disorders ranges from 20 to 85% of patients (Blumenthal and Dennis, 2008; 18781191, Zbuk and Eng, 2007; 17167516). The estimated incidence of Cowden syndrome is 1/200,000, which may be an underestimate due to the high variability of this disorder (Blumenthal and Dennis, 2008; 18781191).

RNF43 alterations have been reported predominantly in endometrial (18_27%) (Kinde et al., 2013; 23303603, Giannakis et al., 2014; 25344691) and gastrointestinal cancers such as colorectal cancer (CRC; 19%) (Giannakis et al., 2014; 25344691, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Seeber et al., 2022; 35254413) and gastric cancer (11_18%) (Wang et al., 2014; 24816253, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014; 25079317), where they are associated with MMR deficiency and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Giannakis et al., 2014; 25344691, Seeber et al., 2022; 35254413, Elez et al., 2022; 36097219, Quintanilha et al., 2023; 36779536, Wang et al., 2014; 24816253, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014; 25079317). One study found that patients with Stage 4 RNF43_mutated right_sided CRC had significantly worse OS than patients with RNF43_wildtype right_sided or RNF43_mutated left_sided CRC (Matsumoto et al., 2020; 32236609). Co_occurrence of RNF43 and KRAS activating mutations are associated with numerically poorer outcomes in CRC (Tsukiyama et al., 2020; 32934222). RNF43 alterations may lead to WNT activation and therefore may confer sensitivity to WNT pathway inhibitors such as porcupine (PORCN) inhibitors (Hao et al., 2012; 22575959, Koo et al., 2012; 22895187, Jiang et al., 2013; 23847203, Koo et al., 2015; 26023187, Tsukiyama et al., 2015; 25825523), but this has not been clinically established (Cook et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 517MO, Tabanero et al., 2023; 36811382). In a Phase 1 basket study of the PORCN inhibitor RXC004, SD was reported for 1/2 patients with RNF43_mutated tumors (Cook et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 517MO). RNF43 mutations did not clearly correlate with change in tumor baseline in a Phase 2 study of the addition of the PORCN inhibitor WNT974 to the combination of encorafenib and cetuximab to treat patients with BRAF V600E_mutated metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) (Tabanero et al., 2023; 36811382). A meta_analysis of patients with BRAF V600E_mutated CRC suggests that RNF43 mutations may predict improved clinical benefit from BRAF/EGFR combinatorial therapies in the context of microsatellite_stable disease (Elez et al., 2022; 36097219).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Based on preclinical evidence, tumors with loss or inactivation of RNF43 may be sensitive to inhibitors of the WNT signaling pathway.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT02521844", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03447470", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TSC2", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "R57H", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"dnaFraction": "43.15", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "R57H"}}, "Interpretation": "The tumor suppressor protein Tuberin (TSC2) binds with Hamartin (TSC1) to inhibit mTOR signaling and cell growth (Inoki et al., 2003; 12869586, Tee et al., 2003; 12906785). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TSC2 function or expression (Hodges et al., 2001; 11741833, Jozwiak, 2006; 16206276, Li et al., 2004; 15340059). TSC2 mutation and loss have been reported in up to 1.8% and 4.2%, respectively, of prostate carcinoma samples analyzed in large datasets (Armenia et al., 2018; 29610475, Nguyen et al., 2020; 32317181, Abida et al., 2017; 28825054, Abida et al., 2019; 31061129). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of TSC2 alterations in prostate carcinoma are limited (PubMed, Feb 2023). Loss or inactivation of TSC2 can activate mTOR signaling (Tee et al., 2003; 12906785). MTOR inhibitors such as everolimus, temsirolimus, and sirolimus have shown activity against tumors associated with the genetic disease tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), including subependymal giant cell astrocytomas and renal angiomyolipomas (Kwiatkowski et al., 2015; 25782670, Luo et al., 2021; 34217357, Choi et al., 2020; EAU Abstract 103, Wang et al., 2020; 31597506, Guo et al., 2021; 33575217, Espinosa et al., 2018; 29764404, Chuang et al., 2017; 28547571). Sirolimus and nab_sirolimus have shown activity for patients with TSC2_altered malignant perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (Wagner et al., 2010; 20048174, Dickson et al., 2013; 22927055, Wagner et al., 2021; 34637337, Cranmer et al., 2023; AACR Abstract LB288). Nab_sirolimus has also shown limited activity for patients with TSC2_mutated sarcomas as a monotherapy (Dickson et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 3111) or in combination with nivolumab (Gordon et al., 2023; 37097693). In the context of TSC2_altered malignancies unrelated to TSC, everolimus and temsirolimus activity has been limited (Adib et al., 2021; 33727259, Nassar et al., 2020; 31653662, Voss et al., 2019; 3032730) with the exception of anecdotal reports across various solid tumors, including anaplastic thyroid cancer (Wagle et al., 2014; 25295501), renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (Tannir et al., 2015; 26626617, Maroto et al., 2018; 29632054), glioblastoma (GBM) (Zureick et al., 2019; 31154346), and central nervous system embryonal tumor (Hu et al., 2020; 33344249), as well as a case of Hodgkin lymphoma (Perini et al., 2016; 27176796). In the prospective NCI_MATCH study, only 6.7% (1/15) of patients with TSC2_mutated solid tumors responded to everolimus, with the single response reported for 1 patient with uterine leiomyosarcoma (Adib et al., 2021; 33727259). Retrospective analyses of the RECORD_3, GRANITE_1, and EVOLVE_1 studies of everolimus to treat patients with RCC, gastric cancer, or hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively, showed no significant association between alterations in MTOR, TSC1, or TSC2 and median PFS (Voss et al., 2019; 30327302). Inactivating germline mutations in TSC2 are associated with the autosomal dominant disorder tuberous sclerosis complex, which results in the development of hamartomas in multiple organ systems and an increased risk of developing renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (Gomez, 1991; 2039135, Kandt et al., 1992; 1303246, European Chromosome 16 Tuberous Sclerosis Consortium, 1993; 8269512). TSC2 mutations account for approximately 75 to 80% of reported sporadic cases (Curatolo et al., 2008; 18722871). Prevalence for this disorder in the general population is estimated to be 1/6,000 from birth and 1/12,000 to 1/14,000 in children under 10 years of age (Curatolo et al., 2008; 18722871).

This sample harbors a TMB level that may be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors in multiple solid tumor types (Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915). Prostate acinar adenocarcinoma harbors a median TMB of 2.7 mutations per megabase (muts/Mb), and 3.4% of cases have high TMB (>20 muts/Mb) (FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). Prostate cancer has been reported to harbor a relatively low TMB among solid tumors (Lawrence et al., 2013; 23770567, Alexandrov et al., 2013; 23945592), with approximately 0.5_1.5 (muts/Mb) in localized tumor samples (Barbieri et al., 2012; 22610119, Baca et al., 2013; 23622249, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26544944), and a higher but still low TMB of 2_5 muts/Mb in metastatic, castration_resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) samples (Grasso et al., 2012; 22722839, Gundem et al., 2015; 25830880, cBio_Robinson et al., 2015; 26000489). One study reported that 4 of 150 (2.7%) mCRPC cases harbored high TMB (nearly 50 muts/Mb), which was due to defects in mismatch repair genes MLH1 and MSH2 in 3 of the 4 cases (cBio_Robinson et al., 2015; 26000489). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of tumor mutational burden in prostate cancer are limited (PubMed, Feb 2023). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In multiple pan_tumor studies, increased tissue tumor mutational burden (TMB) was associated with sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947, Ott et al., 2019; 30557521, Cristescu et al., 2022; 35101941, Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). In the KEYNOTE 158 trial of pembrolizumab monotherapy for patients with solid tumors, significant improvement in ORR was observed for patients with TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb (as measured by this assay) compared with those with TMB <10 Muts/Mb in a large cohort that included multiple tumor types (Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526); similar findings were observed in the KEYNOTE 028 and 012 trials (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915). At the same TMB cutpoint, retrospective analysis of patients with solid tumors treated with any checkpoint inhibitor identified that tissue TMB scores \u2265 10 Muts/Mb were associated with prolonged time to treatment failure compared with scores <10 muts/Mb (HR=0.68) (Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). For patients with solid tumors treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab in the CheckMate 848 trial, improved responses were observed in patients with a tissue TMB \u2265 10 Muts/Mb independent of blood TMB at any cutpoint in matched samples (Schenker at al., 2022; AACR Abstract 7845). However, support for higher TMB thresholds and efficacy was observed in the prospective Phase 2 MyPathway trial of atezolizumab for patients with pan_solid tumors, where improved ORR and DCR was seen in patients with TMB \u2265 16 Muts/Mb than those with TMB \u2265 10 and <16 Muts/Mb (Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409). Similarly, analyses across several solid tumor types reported that patients with higher TMB (defined as \u226516_20 Muts/Mb) achieved greater clinical benefit from PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting monotherapy compared with patients with higher TMB treated with chemotherapy (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000) or those with lower TMB treated with PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting agents (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386). The Phase 2 CheckMate 650 trial of nivolumab and ipilimumab treatment for patients with metastatic castration_resistant prostate cancer reported that patients harboring above the median study TMB experienced increased ORR and PSA responses (Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). A real_world study for patients with pretreated metastatic castration_resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) reported longer time to next therapy (TTNT) for patients with high tumor mutational burden (TMB; \u226510 Muts/Mb) treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) compared with those treated with taxane chemotherapies, whereas for patients with low TMB (<10 Muts/Mb), treatment with ICIs resulted in worse TTNT compared with taxanes (Graf et al., 2022; 35357449).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Increased tumor mutational burden may predict response to anti_PD_1 (alone or in combination with anti_CTLA_4) or anti_PD_L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors.", "Therapies": {"Therapy": [{"Name": null, "GenericName": "Atezolizumab", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Atezolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to PD_L1 and blocks its interaction with PD_1 to enhance antitumor immune responses.

An association between higher TMB and improved OS, median PFS, and ORR has been observed in large pan_solid tumor studies for patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386). </p> <p><b>Supporting Data:</b> A Phase 1 study evaluating atezolizumab monotherapy for patients with heavily pretreated metastatic castration_resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) reported limited efficacy, with only 4% (1/25) of patients achieving PR and 8.6% (3/35) of patients with a confirmed prostate_specific antigen (PSA) response, a PFS of 2.7 months, and median OS (mOS) of 14.7 months (Petrylak et al., 2021; 33568344). The Phase 3 IMbassador250 study evaluating atezolizumab and enzalutamide versus enzalutamide alone failed to meet its primary endpoint of OS (HR=1.12) for patients with mCRPC previously treated with abiraterone; no differences were observed for radiographic PFS (HR=0.90) or time to PSA progression (HR=1.04) between treatment groups, though an increase in responders was observed in the atezolizumab arm (12% vs. 6.7% PRs) (Powles et al., 2022; 35013615).

One study identified strong cytoplasmic CBL expression by immunohistochemistry in prostate cancer samples as compared with normal prostate tissue; increased levels of CBL protein were a significant independent predictor of reduced patient survival (Knight et al., 2008; 19002168). CBL inactivation may lead to the hyperactivation of various receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including MET (Mancini et al., 2002; 11847211), PDGFRA (Miyake et al., 1998; 9653117), KIT (Masson et al., 2006; 16780420), VEGFR2 (Singh et al., 2007; 17372230), and the TAM (TYRO3, AXL, MER) RTKs (Paolino et al., 2014; 24553136). These RTKs are targets of the multikinase inhibitor sitravatinib (Patwardhan et al., 2016; 26675259), which has shown activity in CBL_mutated advanced solid tumors (Bazhenova et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract 408O).

BCR signaling is considered an important oncogenic pathway in several types of lymphomas, and somatic mutations in CD79A and especially CD79B have been reported to occur frequently in the activated B_cell_like (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B_cell lymphoma (DLBCL) but only rarely or not at all in the other DLBCLs and types of lymphomas studied (Young and Staudt, 2013; 23449308, Davis et al., 2010; 20054396). Although alterations such as seen here have not been fully characterized and are of unknown functional significance, similar alterations have been previously reported in the context of cancer, which may indicate biological relevance.

In a Phase 1/2 study of ibrutinib for patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL, 1 patient with a subclonal 45bp deletion affecting the CD79A ITAM domain experienced a CR (Wilson et al., 2015; 26193343). Limited preclinical data in ABC_DLBCL cell lines suggest that CD79A mutation may also be associated with sensitivity to the SRC/BCR_ABL kinase inhibitor dasatinib (Davis et al., 2010; 20054396) or to PKC inhibition (Naylor et al., 2011; 21324920).

CTCF plays a role in transcriptional regulation of a number of key cancer_associated genes, including the oncogene MYC (Gombert and Krumm, 2009; 19568426) and tumor suppressor TP53 (Soto_Reyes and Recillas_Targa, 2010; 20101205), via maintenance of local DNA methylation status. Decreased expression levels of CTCF and/or BORIS, another 11_zinc_finger transcriptional regulator, were reported to be closely associated with global DNA methylation variability and decreased OS in epithelial ovarian cancer (Woloszynska_Read et al., 2011; 21296871, Kemp et al., 2014; 24794443). Somatic mutations in CTCF are infrequently reported in most cancers, but have been observed more commonly (24%) in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (cBioPortal, 2023)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210); nearly half of the observed mutations were truncating, suggesting a tumor suppressor role for CTCF in this disease. In addition, CTCF has been found to act as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer cell line studies (M\u00e9ndez_Catal\u00e1 et al., 2013; 23908591, Tiffen et al., 2013; 23553099).

Alpha_catenin acts as a tumor suppressor, through mechanisms that can vary by tissue (Kobielak and Fuchs, 2004; 15366705, Bajpai et al., 2009; 19458087). Alpha_catenin is one of three catenin proteins that are in complex with E_cadherin to help mediate cell_cell adhesion in epithelial tumor suppression (Kobielak and Fuchs, 2004; 15366705, Bajpai et al., 2009; 19458087); loss of cell adhesion may contribute to cancer cell invasiveness and formation of metastases. In epidermal cells, alpha_catenin acts as a tumor suppressor by inducing YAP1 phosphorylation and cytoplasmic localization (Silvis et al., 2011; 21610251, Piao et al., 2014; 24509793). Alpha_catenin also acts as a tumor suppressor by interacting with IKBalpha to influence the NF_KB pathway in E_cadherin_negative basal_like breast cancer cells (Piao et al., 2014; 24509793). Loss of alpha_catenin expression is also hypothesized to alter the balance between the cytoplasmic (cell adhesion) and nuclear (cell proliferation) functions of beta_catenin, further contributing to oncogenesis (Inge et al., 2008; 18566211). CTNNA1 mutations have been observed with highest incidence in endometrial carcinoma (7.0%)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2018; 29625048), cutaneous melanoma (6.4%)(Van Allen., 2014; 24265153), colorectal adenocarcinoma (4.9%)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2018; 29625048), and stomach adenocarcinoma (3.90%) TCGA datasets (cBioPortal, 2023)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). CTNNA1 mutations have been observed in patients with hereditary diffuse gastric carcinoma without CDH1 mutations (Hansford et al., 2015; 26182300, Majewski et al., 2013; 23208944). Reduced CTNNA1 expression in patients with breast cancer has been correlated with a poor clinical outcome and breast cancer brain metastasis (Ding et al., 2010; 20393555, Piao et al., 2014; 24509793). Deletion and hypermethylation of CTNNA1 has been observed in up to 22% (18/83) of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) cases and associated with poor clinicopathological features (Qian et al., 2014; 25153418, Ye et al., 2009; 19826047, Liu et al., 2007; 17159988, Ye et al., 2009; 19826047) and a trend for inferior survival (Qian et al., 2014; 25153418). Loss of CTNNA1 expression via 5q deletion or hypermethylation has been reported as a frequent event in acute myeloid leukemia and associated with shorter relapse_free survival in one study (Liu et al., 2007; 17159988, Chen et al., 2014; 24685333, Li et al., 2016; 27129146).

Ephrin signaling has been implicated in multiple processes, including cell adhesion, cytoskeletal organization, and cell migration (Pasquale, 2008; 18394988), and signaling between EPHB4 and its ligand EphrinB2 is particularly important for angiogenesis (Salvucci and Tosato, 2012; 22588055, Pitulescu and Adams, 2010; 21078817). EPHB receptors, including EPHB4, have been shown to undergo dysregulation (amplification, mutation, under_ or overexpression) in a number of different cancer types (Pasquale, 2010; 20179713). EPHB4 amplification has been reported in several solid tumor types (Hasina et al., 2013; 23100466, Boberg et al., 2013; 23063927, Masood et al., 2006; 16615113, Sinha et al., 2006; 17043250, Cromer et al., 2004; 14676830) and was associated with advanced disease stage in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) (Sinha et al., 2006; 17043250).

High EPHB4 expression has been associated with inferior survival in multivariate analyses for patients with CRC treated with bevacizumab [hazard ratio (HR) = 5.95] (Guijarro_Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2013; 23579861), HNSCC (HR = 2.95) (Yavrouian et al., 2008; 18794445), epithelial ovarian cancer (HR = 4.53) (Pradeep et al., 2015; 26481148), or glioma (HR = 3.21) (Tu et al., 2012; 22374425). There are no approved therapies available to target EPHB4 alterations in cancer. sEPHB4 is a soluble monomeric extracellular domain of EPHB4 that functions as an antagonist of EphrinB2_EPHB4 interaction (Kertesz et al., 2006; 16322467), and fusion of sEPHB4 with human serum albumin (HSA) increases its stability (Shi et al., 2012; 22411527). Recombinant sEPHB4_HSA is under investigation in clinical trials. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that sEPHB4_HSA inhibits cell proliferation and xenograft tumor growth, including for cells expressing cancer_associated EPHB4 mutants or overexpressing wild_type EPHB4 (Kertesz et al., 2006; 16322467, Li et al., 2014; 25148033, Liu et al., 2013; 23721559, Bhatia et al., 2016; 27941840, Scehnet et al., 2009; 18836096, Ferguson et al., 2015; 26073592). In addition, small_molecule inhibitors targeting multiple tyrosine kinases including EPHB4, such as JI_101 and XL647, have been under preclinical and clinical investigation (Werner et al., 2015; 26365907, Pietanza et al., 2012; 22011666, Pietanza et al., 2012; 22722787).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "ERRFI1", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "F411fs*41", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"dnaFraction": "41.02", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "F411fs*41"}}, "Interpretation": "The ERRFI1 gene (also known as MIG6 or RALT) encodes a tumor suppressor that negatively regulates the ERBB family of receptors (Anastasi et al., 2003; 12833145, Anastasi et al., 2007; 17599051, Zhang et al., 2007; 18046415, Anastasi et al., 2005; 15856022), and is transcriptionally activated by RAS_RAF_ERK signaling (Fiorini et al., 2002; 12226756). ERRFI1 directly binds to the kinase domain of ERBB proteins and consequently antagonizes their oncogenic signaling and cell proliferation (Anastasi et al., 2003; 12833145, Anastasi et al., 2007; 17599051, Zhang et al., 2007; 18046415, Anastasi et al., 2005; 15856022). ERRFI1 also negatively regulates signaling by promoting EGFR endocytosis and degradation (Frosi et al., 2010; 20421427, Ying et al., 2010; 20351267). Knockout or depletion of ERRFI1 was shown to result in EGFR and ERBB2/ERBB3 activation (Fiorini et al., 2002; 12226756, Ferby et al., 2006; 16648858, Reschke et al., 2010; 20044804, Ying et al., 2010; 20351267), and disruption of the ERRFI1 gene promoted tumorigenesis in mice (Ferby et al., 2006; 16648858, Zhang et al., 2007; 16819504), whereas overexpression of ERRFI1 inhibited EGFR_ or ERBB2_mediated signaling and oncogenic transformation in vitro (Hackel et al., 2001; 11843178, Fiorentino et al., 2000; 11003669, Ying et al., 2010; 20351267). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt ERRFI1 function or expression (Zhang et al., 2007; 18046415, Anastasi et al., 2003; 12833145). ERRFI1 mutation has been reported in 0_2% of metastatic prostate cancer cases (cBio_Robinson et al., 2015; 26000489, cBio_Grasso et al., 2012; 22722839). In one study, ERRFI1 was identified as one of 87 genes with significantly altered expression levels in prostate cancer cell lines upon androgen treatment (Romanuik et al., 2009; 19832994). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of ERRFI1 alterations in prostate carcinoma are limited (PubMed, Nov 2022). ERRFI1 loss or inactivating mutations may result in EGFR activation and predict sensitivity to ERBB tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, and lapatinib, which are approved to treat lung or breast cancers. One patient with cholangiocarcinoma and an ERRFI1 loss of function mutation was reported to have a partial response to the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib (Borad et al., 2014; 24550739). In preclinical studies, the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib was reported to cause regression of tumors in ERRFI1 knockout mice (Ferby et al., 2006; 16648858) and inhibit signaling downstream EGFR in ERRFI1_depleted human cell lines (Walsh and Lazarra., 2013; 23868981).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "FH", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "splice site 1237_1G>A", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"dnaFraction": "38.43", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "splice site 1237_1G>A"}}, "Interpretation": "FH encodes fumarate hydratase, an enzymatic component of the Krebs cycle. FH has been identified as a possible hypoxia inducible factor activating gene (Morris et al., 2004; 15220362).

FH mutations are rare in solid and hematologic malignancies (cBio_Zehir et al., 2017; 28481359). FH_deficient renal cell carcinoma (RCC) arises in about 20% of families affected by hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC) and is associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis (Schmidt et al., 2020; 31085323, Lau et al., 2020; 31524643, Gardie et al., 2011; 21398687). A preclinical study showed that FH_deficient renal cancer cells are dependent on ABL1 activity and sensitive to the multikinase inhibitor vandetanib; treatment with vandetanib inhibited the growth and tumorigenicity of these cells in vitro and in vivo (Sourbier et al., 2014; 25490448). Tumors with FH loss or inactivation may therefore be sensitive to vandetanib, which is approved to treat medullary thyroid cancer and is in clinical trials in solid tumors. A Phase 2 trial of bevacizumab and erlotinib reported overall response rate in 60% (12/20) of patients with hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer, and 29% (6/21) of patients with sporadic papillary renal cell carcinoma (Srinivasan et al., 2014; EORTC_NCI_AACR Abstract 5).

MAPK1_mediated activation of Wnt/beta_catenin signaling through osteopontin has been implicated in cholangiocarcinoma progression (Zheng et al., 2018; 29415992).

Defective MMR occurring as a result of mutation(s) in the MMR family (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2) can result in microsatellite instability (MSI), common in colon, endometrium, and stomach cancers (You et al., 2010; 21081928). Although alterations such as seen here have not been fully characterized and are of unknown functional significance, similar alterations have been previously reported in the context of cancer, which may indicate biological relevance. MLH1 mutation has been reported in 0_1.6% of prostate carcinoma cases (cBio_Robinson et al., 2015; 26000489, cBio_Baca et al., 2013; 23622249, cBio_Barbieri et al., 2012; 22610119, cBio_Taylor et al., 2010; 20579941, cBio_Grasso et al., 2012; 22722839). Approximately 12% (7/60) of prostate cancers were found to be hypermutated, with two of the hypermutated cases having MLH1 mutations (Pritchard et al., 2014; 25255306). MLH1 expression was shown to be reduced in approximately 50% of 39 prostate tumors analyzed in one study (Chen et al., 2003; 12684669). In another analysis, MLH1 nuclear expression was detected in 85% (6220/7275) prostate cancers; strong expression of MLH1 was observed in 55.2% of TMPRSS2_ERG_positive cases, but only in 32.9% of TMPRSS2_ERG_negative cases (Wilczak et al., 2017; 27803051). MLH1 expression was significantly associated with early biochemical recurrence in univariate analyses in one study (Wilczak et al., 2017; 27803051). MLH1 inactivation leads to MMR defects, high MSI, and increased mutational burden (Bronner et al., 1994; 8145827, Gazzoli et al., 2002; 12124320, Boland et al., 2010; 20420947, Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696), which may predict response to the anti_PD_1 immunotherapies pembrolizumab and nivolumab (Le et al., 2015; 26028255, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070, Lipson et al., 2013; 23169436). In a Phase 2 study of pembrolizumab in MSI_high colorectal cancer (CRC), three patients with MLH1 (germline) mutations experienced one partial response and two stable diseases (Le et al., 2015; 26028255). Pembrolizumab demonstrated a significantly higher objective response rate in MSI_high CRC compared with microsatellite stable CRC (40% vs. 0%) (Le et al., 2015; 26028255) and its efficacy correlated with high mutational burden in non_small cell lung cancer (Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070). Nivolumab achieved a complete response in a patient with MSI_high CRC (Lipson et al., 2013; 23169436). Furthermore, MSI status correlates with higher PD_1 and PD_L1 expression (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179), potential biomarkers of response to anti_PD_1 immunotherapies. These therapies are in clinical trials for various tumor types and may be appropriate, particularly for hypermutant tumors. It is not known whether these therapeutic approaches would be relevant in the context of alterations that have not been fully characterized, as seen here. One or more of the MLH1 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with Lynch syndrome (ClinVar, Apr 2023)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in MLH1 are associated with an autosomal dominant condition known as Lynch syndrome (also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or HNPCC), which is characterized by increased risk of a number of cancers (Lynch et al., 2009; 19659756). Approximately 50% of Lynch syndrome_associated mutations have been attributed to alterations in MLH1 (Peltomaki, 2005; 16083711). Lynch syndrome accounts for 1_7% of all colorectal cancers and has an estimated prevalence in the general population between 1:600 and 1:2000 (Silva et al., 2009; 19466295, Sehgal et al., 2014; 24978665, de la Chapelle et al., 2005; 16136383).

Germline de novo mutations of MLL2 are responsible for the majority of cases of Kabuki syndrome, a complex and phenotypically distinctive developmental disorder (Hannibal et al., 2011; 21671394). A significant number of inactivating MLL2 alterations have been observed in multiple tumor types, suggesting a tumor suppressor role (Fagan et al.,2019; 31128216). MLL2 alterations are observed in a number of solid tumor contexts (cBio_Zehir et al., 2017; 28481359), and are especially prevalent in lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network et al., 2012; 22960745) and small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) (Augert et al., 2017; 28007623). MLL2 mutation was found to be an independent prognostic factor of poor PFS and OS in non_small cell lung cancer, but not in SCLC (Ardeshir_Larijani et al., 2018; 29627316). One study reported that MLL2 truncating mutations were more common in recurrent ovary granulosa cell tumors (GCT) compared with primary GCTs (24% [10/42] vs. 3.0% [1/32])(Hillman et al., 2018; 29950560). In a study of esophageal SCC, high MLL2 expression positively correlated with tumor stage, differentiation, and size, and negatively correlated with OS (Abudureheman et al., 2018; 29532228). There are no targeted therapies available to address genomic alterations in MLL2. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors may detect nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066).

Alterations such as seen here may disrupt MSH2 function or expression (Christensen et al., 2009; 19697156, Drost et al., 2012; 22102614, Gammie et al., 2007; 17720936, Houlleberghs et al., 2016; 26951660, Li et al., 2008; 18157157, Lutzen et al., 2008; 18822302, Martinez et al., 2010; 20176959, Mastrocola et al., 2010; 20672385, Ollila et al., 2006; 17101317, Ollila et al., 2008; 18951462, Petersen et al., 2013; 24090359, Ward et al., 2002; 12200596, Wielders et al., 2014; 24501230). MSH2 mutations are rare in prostate carcinoma and have not been detected in this context in multiple datasets (cBio_Baca et al., 2013; 23622249, cBio_Barbieri et al., 2012; 22610119, cBio_Taylor et al., 2010; 20579941, cBio_Grasso et al., 2012; 22722839). Deep deletion of MSH2 has been observed in ~1% of prostate carcinoma samples in large datasets (cBio_Armenia et al., 2018; 29610475, cBio_Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2015; 26544944). Loss of MSH2 protein expression was detected in 1.2% (14/1176) of primary prostate cancer samples in 1 study; of these 14 samples that could be further analyzed, 12/12 samples had loss of function alterations in MSH2 which included biallelic inactivation or hypermutation (Guedes et al., 2017; 28790115). A study of 59 patients with hormone_sensitive prostate cancer identified MSH2, CDK12, RB1, and TP53 alterations as independent risk factors for early progression to castration_resistant prostate cancer (Wang et al., 2022; 36401126). Multiple studies have correlated low or absent MSH2 expression with a decreased risk of recurrence and increased disease_free survival and OS in patients with prostate cancer (Prtilo et al., 2005; 16217293, Velasco et al., 2002; 12432247, Burger et al., 2006; 16924473, Velasco et al., 2002; 11857301). MSH2 inactivation leads to MMR defects, MSI, and high mutational burden (Mensenkamp et al., 2014; 24333619, Joly et al., 2015; 25504677, Pritchard et al., 2014; 25255306, Rosty et al., 2014; 25117503, McConechy et al., 2015; 25636458), which may predict response to the anti_PD_1 immunotherapies pembrolizumab and nivolumab (Le et al., 2015; 26028255, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070, Lipson et al., 2013; 23169436). In a Phase 2 study of MSI_high cancers, six patients with MSH2 (germline) mutations reported one partial response and two stable diseases (Le et al., 2015; 26028255). Pembrolizumab therapy resulted in a significantly higher objective response rate in MSI_high CRC compared with microsatellite stable CRC (40% vs. 0%) (Le et al., 2015; 26028255) and its efficacy correlated with high mutational burden in non_small cell lung cancer (Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070). Treatment with nivolumab resulted in a complete response in a patient with MSI_high CRC (Lipson et al., 2013; 23169436). Furthermore, MSI status correlates with higher PD_1 and PD_L1 expression (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179), potential biomarkers of response to PD_1 targeted immunotherapies. These therapies are in clinical trials for various tumor types and may be appropriate, particularly in hypermutant tumors. Preclinical studies have shown that tumor cells deficient in MSH2 are markedly sensitive to methotrexate in vitro (Martin et al., 2009; 20049736). Low levels of MSH2 have been observed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in NSCLC and may predict benefit to cisplatin_based adjuvant chemotherapy (Kamal et al., 2010; 20145178, Pierceall et al., 2012; 22269178). Germline mutations in MSH2 are associated with an autosomal dominant condition known as Lynch syndrome (also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or HNPCC), which is characterized by increased risk of a number of cancers (Lynch et al., 2009; 19659756). In one large study of Lynch syndrome, endometrial cancer was the most common cancer reported outside the colon, with an incidence of 13.8% (Pande et al., 2012; 22714864). For family members of patients with newly diagnosed endometrial cancer, the clinical utility of testing the patient for germline mutations in MMR genes is higher for mutations in MLH1 or MSH2 than it is for MSH6 or PMS2 mutations (Stewart, 2013; 24056992).

Inactivating MSH3 frameshift mutations may increase microsatellite instability (MSI) and lead to the production of elevated microsatellite alterations at selected tetranucleotide repeats (EMAST) (Haugen et al., 2008; 18922920, Lee at al., 2010; 20708618), which have been recognized as a genomic signature in colorectal cancer (CRC) with MSI (Watson et al., 2014; 24691426, Campregher et al., 2012; 23209772). Certain germline polymorphisms in MSH3 have been reported to increase the risk of various cancers including CRC (Miao et al., 2015; 26617824, Morak et al., 2017; 28528517, Duraturo et al., 2011; 21128252, Reeves et al., 2012; 21974800, Berndt et al., 2007; 17205513, Adam et al., 2016; 27476653), breast (Miao et al., 2015; 26617824, Yang et al., 2015; 25927356), esophageal (Vogelsang et al., 2012; 22623965), prostate (Jafary et al., 2012; 23464402, Hirata et al., 2008; 18355840, Miao et al., 2015; 26617824), gastric (Ohmiya et al., 2001; 11470537), and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) (Nogueira et al., 2015; 25598504). For patients with metastatic disease, MSH3 mutations have been reported with highest prevalence (4_5%) in colorectal (CRC) and endometrial cancers and are rare (<1%) in other tumor types such as prostate, lung, breast, ovarian, or pancreatic (Nguyen et al., 2022; 35120664). MSH3 loss has been correlated with the late development and progression of a variety of sporadic cancers including lung, ovarian, bladder, breast, and CRC tumors (Plaschke et al., 2012; 22249440, Benachenhou et al., 1998; 9650548, Kawakami et al., 2004; 15541380, Benachenhou et al., 1999; 10098729, Plaschke et al., 2004; 14871813). Certain germline polymorphisms in MSH3 have been associated with poor prognosis in CRC (Plaschke et al., 2004; 14871813), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) (Nogueira et al., 2015; 25598504), non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Xu et al., 2015; 25966119), and pancreatic cancer (Dong et al., 2011; 21212431), while MSH3 loss was associated with improved post_surgery outcome in 1 study of patients with MLH1_deficient CRC (Laghi et al., 2012; 22496206). Preclinical studies in the context of MSH3_deficient cancer cells have demonstrated antitumor efficacy of DNA_PKcs inhibitors (Dietlein et al., 2014; 24556366) and PARP inhibitors such as olaparib (Takahashi et al., 2011; 21285347) as well as increased chemosensitivity to cisplatin, oxaliplatin, and SN_38 (Park et al., 2013; 23724141, Takahashi et al., 2011; 21285347).

MSH6 mutations have been reported at low frequencies in prostate adenocarcinoma, in up to 1% of cases across several studies (cBio_Baca et al., 2013; 23622249, cBio_Barbieri et al., 2012; 22610119, cBio_Taylor et al., 2010; 20579941, cBio_Grasso et al., 2012; 22722839). In one study, 10% (5/50) of primary advanced prostate cancer samples analyzed were reported to be hypermutated and characterized by MSI; of these hypermutated tumors, 4/5 harbored inactivating mutations in MSH6 and/or MSH2 and loss of MSH6 and/or MSH2 protein expression (Pritchard et al., 2014; 25255306). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of MSH6 alterations in prostate cancer are limited (PubMed, Oct 2022). Numerous studies in various cancer types have shown that MSH6 loss or inactivation is associated with MSI and increased mutation burden (Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696, You et al., 2010; 21081928, Joly et al., 2015; 25504677, Pritchard et al., 2014; 25255306, Rosty et al., 2014; 25117503, McConechy et al., 2015; 25636458). Clinical studies have shown that MSI is associated with patient responses to anti_programmed death 1 (PD_1) immune checkpoint inhibitors pembrolizumab (Le et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract LBA100)(Le et al., 2015; 26028255) and nivolumab (Lipson et al., 2013; 23169436). Higher mutation burden was also reported to be associated with response to pembrolizumab (Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070). Furthermore, MSI status correlates with higher PD_1 and PD_L1 expression (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179), potential biomarkers of response to PD_1 targeted immunotherapies. Therefore, inactivation of MSH6 may confer sensitivity to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors. Germline mutations in MSH6 are associated with both \"typical\" and \"atypical\" forms of autosomal dominant Lynch syndrome (also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or HNPCC), which accounts for 1_7% of all colorectal cancers (Silva et al., 2009; 19466295). Approximately 10% of all Lynch syndrome_associated mutations have been attributed to alterations in MSH6 (Peltomaki, 2005; 16083711). Carriers of mutations in MSH6 have a 60_80% risk of colorectal cancer (Kastrinos and Syngal, 2007; 17920897). Lynch syndrome has an estimated prevalence in the general population ranging from 1:600 to 1:2000 (Silva et al., 2009; 19466295, Sehgal et al., 2014; 24978665, de la Chapelle et al., 2005; 16136383). Biallelic germline mutation of MSH6 has been shown to account for 20% of cases of the very rare syndrome Constitutional Mismatch Repair Deficiency (CMMRD), which is characterized by a 95% incidence rate of childhood onset lymphoma, leukemia and brain tumors, followed by early_onset colorectal cancer (reviewed in Wimmer et al., 2008; 18709565, Wimmer et al., 2014; 24737826, Scott et al., 2007; 17259933, Ripperger et al., 2010; 20015892, Baris et al., 2016; 26544533).

Upon binding of membrane_bound ligands, NOTCH signaling involves cleavage of the NOTCH intracellular domain (NICD), which subsequently forms part of a transcription factor complex that regulates downstream target genes (Penton et al., 2012; 22306179, Kopan and Ilagan, 2009; 19379690). Alterations that disrupt or remove the transmembrane domain (amino acids 1644_1664), RAM domain (amino acids 1665_1837), and/or ANK repeats region (amino acids 1838_2000), which are necessary for the transcriptional activity of NOTCH family proteins, as well as internal deletions that remove EGF repeats (7_10 and 21_22), have been shown in vitro to negatively affect ligand binding and reduce NOTCH3 transcriptional activity and are predicted to be inactivating (Kopan and Ilagan, 2009; 19379690, Deregowski et al., 2006; 16869730, Be\u00e0 et al., 2013; 24145436, McDaniell et al., 2006; 16773578, Lin et al., 2010; 20068176). NOTCH3 mutations have been reported in up to 2% of metastatic prostate cancers (cBio_Grasso et al., 2012; 22722839, cBio_Robinson et al., 2015; 26000489) but not in two other studies of prostate adenocarcinoma (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26544944, cBio_Barbieri et al., 2012; 22610119). NOTCH3 amplification or overexpression has been associated with poor clinicopathological features in prostate carcinoma, although the role of NOTCH signaling in this disease is complex (Carvalho et al., 2014; 24737393, Kim et al., 2019; 31934201). Several approaches for inhibiting NOTCH3 signaling are being developed, including neutralizing NOTCH antibodies such as tarextumab (OMP_59R5) (Yen et al., 2015; 25934888), which targets NOTCH2 and NOTCH3, and pan_NOTCH inhibitors, such as gamma_secretase inhibitors (GSI) (Hu et al., 2014; 24743243, Konishi et al., 2007; 17804716, Xiao et al., 2011; 20838375). In a Phase 2 study, the GSI AL101 (BMS_906024) elicited PR in 15% (6/39) and SD in 54% (21/39) of patients with metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma harboring NOTCH activating alterations (Ferrarotto et al., 2020; ESMO Abstract 919MO). Phase 2 studies have evaluated the efficacy of tarextumab in combination with chemotherapy in metastatic pancreatic cancer or extensive_stage small cell lung cancer, though NOTCH3 expression was not found to be a predictor of OS or PFS in either study (Hu et al., 2019; 31347292; O\u2019Reilly et al., 2015; Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium Abstract 278, Daniel et al., 2017; ESMO Abstract 1530PD).

TRKB is a receptor for brain_derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurotrophin_4 and is a member of the insulin receptor subfamily (Reichardt, 2006; 16939974, Guiton et al., 1994; 7982951). TRKB activates the RAS_ERK and PI3K_AKT signaling pathways, regulating cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation in normal and neoplastic cells (Massa et al., 2010; 20407211, Huang and Reichardt, 2003; 12676795, Reichardt, 2006; 16939974, Schramm et al., 2005; 15921851). Overexpression of TRKB promotes malignant transformation, cell invasiveness, and tumor metastasis, thereby suggesting a role for NTRK2 as an oncogene (Geiger and Peeper, 2005; 16103047). Although alterations such as seen here have not been fully characterized and are of unknown functional significance, similar alterations have been previously reported in the context of cancer, which may indicate biological relevance. NTRK2 mutation was detected in 8.6% of prostate carcinoma samples in COSMIC (Jun 2023)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of NTRK2 alterations in prostate cancer are limited (PubMed, Jan 2023). Clinical and preclinical data indicate that NTRK fusions predict sensitivity to TRK inhibitors such as larotrectinib, entrectinib, AZD7451, belizatinib, and PLX7486 (Hong et al., 2019; 30624546, Vaishnavi et al., 2013; 24162815, Doebele et al., 2015; 26216294, Tatematsu et al., 2014; 25054037, Wong et al., 2015;26563356, Mody et al., 2015; 26325560, Sartore_Bianchi et al., 2015; 26563355, Farago et al., 2015; 26565381, Drilon et al., 2017; 28183697, Drilon et al., 2018; 29466156, Laetsch et al., 2018; 29606586). In a Phase 1 study, the activity of larotrectinib was limited in patients who harbored NTRK amplification and not observed in patients with NTRK mutations in the absence of fusion (Hong et al., 2019; 30624546). A case study of a patient with esophageal carcinoma who harbored NTRK1 amplification reported a short PR (Hempel et al., 2020; 32323889). It is not known whether these therapeutic approaches would be relevant in the context of alterations that have not been fully characterized, as seen here.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "PMS2", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "Y268fs*39", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"dnaFraction": "46.94", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "Y268fs*39"}}, "Interpretation": "PMS2 encodes an endonuclease that has been shown to play a critical role in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) and apoptotic responses to DNA damage (Shimodaira et al., 2002; 12601175). Both abnormally high levels of PMS2, caused by protein overexpression, and inactivating mutation leading to loss of PMS2 activity have been shown to result in genomic instability, resistance to genotoxic chemotherapy, and increased tumorigenicity in vivo (Gibson et al., 2006; 16426742, van Oers et al., 2010; 20624957). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt PMS2 function or expression (Drost et al., 2013; 24027009, Nakagawa et al., 2004; 15256438, Senter et al., 2008; 18602922, Wang et al., 2014; 23981578, Clendenning et al., 2008; 18178629, Hendriks et al., 2006; 16472587). PMS2 deletion or amplification have been each detected in <0.5% of analyzed prostate carcinomas, and PMS2 mutations have been detected in up to 1% of prostate cancer samples (cBioPortal, COSMIC, Sep 2022)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210, Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). Alterations in MMR genes, including PMS2, associated with increased risk of certain cancers, including prostate carcinoma (Win et al., 2012; 22933731), although data regarding the role of PMS2 in this tumor type are conflicting. Reduced PMS2 expression has been associated with poorly differentiated tumors and more aggressive prostate cancer (Chen et al., 2003; 12684669, Soni et al., 2011; 21348638, Bansal et al., 2012; 23168703, Chen et al., 2001; 11358834). Increased PMS2 expression has been associated with genetic instability and decreased time to recurrence in prostate cancer (Norris et al., 2007; 17044039, Norris et al., 2009; 19124481). Restoring PMS2 expression had a protective effect in a PMS2_deficient preclinical model of prostate cancer, primarily through increased apoptosis (Fukuhara et al., 2015; 26036629). Defective MMR that occurs because of mutation(s) in the MMR family, which includes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2, can result in microsatellite instability (MSI), which is common in colon, endometrial, and stomach cancers (You et al., 2010; 21081928). Alterations in PMS2 can lead to impaired MMR activity (Drost et al., 2013; 24027009), and selective loss of PMS2 by either mutation or loss of expression has been reported in colorectal cancer and endometrial cancer with MSI_high phenotype (Gill et al., 2005; 16166421, Batte et al., 2014; 24933100, McConechy et al., 2015; 25636458). Clinical studies have shown that MSI predicts patient responses to the anti_programmed death 1 (PD_1) immune checkpoint inhibitors pembrolizumab (Le et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract LBA100)(Le et al., 2015; 26028255) and nivolumab (Lipson et al., 2013; 23169436), and alterations resulting in PMS2 functional loss may predict sensitivity to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, this has not been directly demonstrated. One or more of the PMS2 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with Lynch syndrome (ClinVar, Apr 2023)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline PMS2 mutations have been associated with autosomal dominant Lynch syndrome and the rarer autosomal recessive Turcot syndrome (Ramchander et al., 2017; 28381238, Peltomaki et al., 2005; 16136382, Hegde et al., 2014; 24310308). Lynch syndrome (also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or HNPCC) accounts for 1_7% of all colorectal cancers (Silva et al., 2009; 19466295, Sehgal et al., 2014; 24978665). One study reported germline PMS2 mutation in 62% (61/99) of patients diagnosed with Lynch syndrome_associated tumors (Senter et al., 2008; 18602922). Turcot syndrome is characterized by concurring primary brain tumors and colon cancers and/or colorectal adenomas in pediatric patients (De Rosa et al., 2000; 10763829).

PRKAR1A is thought to be a tumor suppressor, and inactivating germline mutations and deletions are associated with Carney complex, an autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by increased risk of primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease, cardiac and other myxomas, endocrine tumors, and schwannomas (Kirschner et al., 2000; 10973256, Carney et al., 2014; 24805858, Bertherat et al., 2009; 19293268, Horvath et al., 2008; 18223213, Salpea et al., 2013; 24170103). Somatic PRKAR1A mutations have also been reported in cardiac myxoma (Maleszewski et al., 2014; 24618615, He et al., 2017; 29262613, Roque et al., 2019; 31874650). PRKAR1A mutations have been reported in less than 1% of solid tumor types and less than 0.5% of hematologic cancer samples analyzed in the COSMIC database (2023)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). Small studies of melanotic schwannoma, a rare tumor that can be sporadic or associated with Carney complex, have identified PRKAR1A mutation in 100% (12/12) (Wang et al., 2015; 26031761) and loss of protein expression in 33% (7/21) (Torres_Mora et al., 2014; 24145644) of cases.

Preclinical studies in colorectal cancer have reported associations of SMAD4 inactivation or loss with sensitivity to inhibitors of Aurora kinase A (Shi et al., 2022; 35393542) and the Wnt/beta_catenin pathway (Park et al., 2022; 35274815).

TP53 mutations have been reported in 18_40% of prostate cancers (Kumar et al., 2011; 21949389, Beltran et al., 2013; 22981675). A study of 59 patients with hormone_sensitive prostate cancer identified MSH2, CDK12, RB1, and TP53 alterations as independent risk factors for early progression to castration_resistant prostate cancer (Wang et al., 2022; 36401126). Overexpression of p53, which is indicative of TP53 dysregulation, has been reported to be significantly more common in late_stage and hormone_refractory prostate cancers and has been found to be associated with prostate_specific antigen (PSA) recurrence in low_ and intermediate_grade prostate cancer (Schlomm et al., 2008; 18552821). TP53 loss has been found to be associated with prostate cancer_specific mortality in univariate analysis (Liu et al., 2013; 23609948). Concurrent alterations in at least 2 of the TP53, RB1, and PTEN genes, as seen in this sample, molecularly define a subtype of prostate cancer with aggressive clinical course and reduced sensitivity to androgen_deprivation therapies (NCCN Prostate Cancer Guidelines, v1.2023)(Corn et al., 2019; 31515154, Tsaur et al., 2019; 30875581, Spetsieris et al., 2020; 33339136, Aparicio et al., 2013; 23649003, Aparicio et al., 2015; 26546618, Koczka et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 193, Aparicio et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5052). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633) or p53 gene therapy such as SGT53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628, Leung et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 4139). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% and SDs in 53% of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wildtype (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 32% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 43% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4_C trial for patients with TP53_ and RAS_mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as eprenetapopt. In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, eprenetapopt combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). A Phase 1 trial of eprenetapopt with pembrolizumab for patients with solid tumors reported an ORR of 10% (3/29) (Park et al., 2022; 36084396). In post_hoc analyses of a Phase 1/2 trial, the addition of carboplatin to cabazitaxel significantly improved PFS (6.0 vs. 2.2 months) and OS (17.4 vs. 9.9 months) for patients with an aggressive variant prostate cancer molecular signature (AVPC_MS, composed of alterations in at least 2 of the genes RB1, TP53, and PTEN); no significant difference in outcomes were observed for patients lacking this signature (NCCN Prostate Cancer Guidelines, v1.2023)(Corn et al., 2019; 31515154). Post_hoc analysis of a Phase 2 trial in metastatic castration_resistant prostate cancer suggests that patients with aggressive variant prostate cancer (AVPC), molecularly characterized by harboring alterations in at least 2 genes of TP53, RB1, and PTEN, as seen in this sample, may benefit from cabazitaxel combined with carboplatin compared with cabazitaxel alone (median PFS of 5.1 vs. 2.2 months, p=0.03; estimated median OS of 11.2 vs. 10.5 months, p=0.11), whereas patients who were AVPC_negative did not benefit from the more intense chemotherapy combination in this study (Corn et al., 2019; 31515154). One or more of the TP53 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with Li_Fraumeni syndrome (ClinVar, Apr 2023)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066).

In post_hoc analyses of a Phase 1/2 trial, the addition of carboplatin to cabazitaxel significantly improved PFS (6.0 vs. 2.2 months) and OS (17.4 vs. 9.9 months) for patients with an aggressive variant prostate cancer molecular signature (AVPC_MS, composed of alterations in at least 2 of the genes RB1, TP53, and PTEN); no significant difference in outcomes were observed for patients lacking this signature (NCCN Prostate Cancer Guidelines, v1.2023)(Corn et al., 2019; 31515154). Post_hoc analysis of a Phase 2 trial in metastatic castration_resistant prostate cancer suggests that patients with aggressive variant prostate cancer (AVPC), molecularly characterized by harboring alterations in at least 2 genes of TP53, RB1, and PTEN, as seen in this sample, may benefit from cabazitaxel combined with carboplatin compared with cabazitaxel alone (median PFS of 5.1 vs. 2.2 months, p=0.03; estimated median OS of 11.2 vs. 10.5 months, p=0.11), whereas patients who were AVPC_negative did not benefit from the more intense chemotherapy combination in this study (Corn et al., 2019; 31515154). One or more of the TP53 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with Li_Fraumeni syndrome (ClinVar, Apr 2023)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}]}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "XRCC2", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "L117fs*17", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"dnaFraction": "37.35", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "L117fs*17"}}, "Interpretation": "XRCC2 encodes a RAD51 homolog involved in homologous recombination; in complex with RAD51 proteins, XRCC2 enables the repair of DNA double_strand breaks caused by genotoxic stresses such as DNA cross_linking agents and ionizing radiation (Cartwright et al., 1998; 9628903, Cui et al., 1999; 10422536, Johnson et al., 1999; 10517641, Griffin et al., 2000; 11025669, Sale et al., 2001; 11528482, Miller et al., 2002; 11744692, Deans et al., 2003; 14678973). Alterations that disrupt the Walker A (residues 48_55) or Walker B (residues 145_149) motifs, or the C_terminal region of XRCC2 involved in RAD51 binding, disrupt homologous recombination by XRCC2 (Hilbers et al., 2016; 27233470, O Regan et al., 2001; 11301337, Rafii et al., 2002; 12023985). The missense mutations R91W, I95L, C120Y, L133P, R188C, and E207G also impair XRCC2 function, although to a lesser extent than alterations leading to premature protein truncation (Hilbers et al., 2016; 27233470). XRCC2 mutation has been seen in 2.4% of colorectal adenocarcinomas (Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696), 2.4% of stomach adenocarcinomas (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079317), and 1.3% of uterus corpus endometrioid carcinomas (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2013; 23636398). High_level amplification of XRCC2 has been reported in 4.7% of ovarian serous cystadenocarcinomas (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2011; 21720365), 3.9% of lung adenocarcinomas (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552), and 1.8% of glioblastomas (cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142), whereas homozygous deletion of XRCC2 has been seen in 3.1% of acute myeloid leukemias (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2013; 23634996), 3% of esophagus_stomach cancers (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2017; 28052061), and 1.4% of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC_Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2015; 25631445). Alterations in other tumor types are more rarely observed (cBioPortal, Jan 2023)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). XRCC2 polymorphisms, including R188H, have been associated with low penetrance risk of developing breast cancer (Rafii et al., 2002; 12023985, Lin et al., 2011; 21632523, Park et al., 2012; 22464251); however, these findings are controversial, with some studies instead showing a protective effect (Pooley et al., 2008; 19064565, Loizidou et al., 2008; 18188695, Brooks et al., 2008; 18398049, Silva et al., 2010; 20004634, Yu et al., 2010; 20127279, He et al., 2014; 24621646). XRCC2 polymorphisms have also been implicated in decreased survival in the context of pancreatic (Li et al., 2006; 16540687, Jiao et al., 2008; 17986315), lung (Yin et al., 2011; 21647442), and rectal (Curtin et al., 2009; 19690184) cancers but reduced risk of bladder (Figueroa et al., 2007; 17557904) and ovarian (He et al., 2014; 24621646) cancers. There are no therapies to directly target XRCC2 inactivation. However, loss of functional XRCC2 is associated with increased sensitivity to DNA cross_linking agents such as mitomycin C and to ionizing radiation (Cui et al., 1999; 10422536, O Regan et al., 2001;

In the setting of MSI_H associated hypermutation, co_occurring mutations are often subclonal passengers resulting from the large number of mutations, rather than acting as traditional drivers. This may impact potential for therapy response (e.g., for the homologous recombination pathway alterations and PARPi, in this case; PMID: 35772050). High TMB resulting from MSI_H has been associated with response to immunotherapy.
