Analytic Interpretation: Single nucleotide variants (SNVs), small insertions and
deletions (INDELs) ( =< 15 nucleotides) and large-scale genomic alterations like
copy number variations (CNVs) of 440 gene, and fusion transcripts of 13 genes.
Analytical Sensitivity: Variants with coverage >= 20, allele frequency >= 5% and
actionable variants with allele frequency >= 2% were retained.
Methodology: Ion 540 Chip / Ion 550 Chip / Ion P1 Chip and Ion GeneStudio S5 Prime
System / Ion Proton System
Procedure(ACTOnco): Extracted genomic DNA was amplified using four pools of primer
pairs targeting coding exons of analyzed genes. Amplicons were ligated with
barcoded adaptors. Quality and quantity of amplified library were determined using
the fragment analyzer (AATI) and Qubit (Invitrogen). Sequencing was performed on
the Ion Proton or Ion S5 sequencer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Raw reads generated
by the sequencer were mapped to the hg19 reference genome using the Ion Torrent
Suite (version 5.10). This test provides uniform coverage of the targeted regions,
enabling target base coverage at 100x >= 85% with a mean coverage >= 500x. Variants
with coverage >= 20, allele frequency >= 5% and actionable variants with allele
frequency >= 2% were retained. ONCOCNV (an established method for calculating copy
number aberrations in amplicon sequencing data by Boeva et al., 2014) was applied
for the normalization of total amplicon number, amplicon GC content, amplicon
length, and technology-related biases, followed by segmenting the sample with a
gene-aware model. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) was calculated by using the
sequenced regions of ACTOnco to estimate the number of somatic nonsynonymous
mutations per megabase of all protein-coding genes. Classification of
microsatellite instability (MSI) status is determined by a machine learning
prediction algorithm. The change of a number of repeats of different lengths from
a pooled microsatellite stable (MSS) baseline in > 400 genomic loci are used as the
features for the algorithm.
Procedure(ACTFusion): The extracted RNA was reverse-transcribed and subjected to
library construction. The quality and quantity of the amplified library was
determined using the fragment analyzer (AATI) and Qubit (Invitrogen). Sequencing
was performed on the Ion Proton or Ion S5 sequencer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All
assays were performed in accordance with ACT Genomics testing SOPs. In summary,
samples with detectable fusions had to meet the following criteria: 1) Number of
unique start sites (SS) for the GSP2 >= 3. 2) Number of supporting reads spanning
the fusion junction >= 5. 3) Percentage of supporting reads spanning the fusion
junction >= 10%.
