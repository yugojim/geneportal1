              <Interpretation>CDK4 encodes the cyclin-dependent kinase 4, which regulates the cell cycle, senescence, and apoptosis (reviewed in Choi et al., 2014; 23644662). CDK4 and its functional homolog CDK6 are activated by D-type cyclins and promote cell cycle progression by inactivating the tumor suppressor Rb (Weinberg et al., 1995; 7736585, Musgrove et al., 2011; 21734724). Amplification of the chromosomal region that includes CDK4 has been reported in multiple cancer types, including lung cancer, glioblastoma, and liposarcoma, and has been associated with overexpression of CDK4 protein (Wikman et al., 2005; 15543620, Rao et al., 2010; 19609742, Dickson et al., 2013; 23569312, Chung et al., 2009; 19574885, Ragazzini et al., 2004; 15024701, Dujardin et al., 2011; 21336260, Zhang et al., 2013; 23393200, Horvai et al., 2009; 19734852). CDK4 amplification has been observed in 9.4% of glioma cases (cBio-Jonsson et al., 2019; 31263031). A study has reported amplification of the 12q14-15 region, where CDK4 and MDM2 reside, in 4.8% (2/42) of glioblastomas (Zheng et al., 2013; 23796897). CDK4 alterations have been correlated with lower mOS compared with CDK4 wildtype in patients with gliomas (22.9 vs. 43.3 months), including oligodendrogliomas (37.1 vs. 60.0 months) and glioblastomas (10.0 vs. 18.5 months)(Guo et al., 2023; 36998447). Amplification of CDK4 and corresponding increased CDK4 protein expression has been reported to be associated with a poorer patient outcome in anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma (Kim et al., 2010; 20080666, Ruano et al., 2009; 19141386, Fischer et al., 2008; 18403636, Bäcklund et al., 2005; 15970925). CDK4 amplification or activation may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors such as abemaciclib, palbociclib, and ribociclib (Dickson et al., 2013; 23569312, Flaherty et al., 2012; 22090362, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27217383, Infante et al., 2016; 27542767). Clinical benefit has been reported for limited tumor types including patients with CDK4-amplified liposarcoma and sarcoma in response to treatment with abemaciclib (Dickson et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 11004), palbociclib (Dickson et al., 2013; 23569312, Dickson et al., 2016; 27124835), and ribociclib (Peguero et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2528).</Interpretation>

              <Interpretation>KIT (also called c-KIT) encodes a cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor that, upon ligand binding and dimerization, activates the PI3K-AKT and RAS-MAPK signaling pathways (Linnekin, 1999; 10582339). KIT aberrations, including point mutations, translocations, amplification, and overexpression, have been associated with various malignancies, and KIT is considered an oncoprotein (Fletcher, 2004; 15175998). KIT has been reported to be amplified in cancer (Gao et al., 2013; 23550210) and may be biologically relevant in this context (Zack et al., 2013; 24071852, Beroukhim et al., 2010; 20164920). Although alterations such as seen here have not been fully characterized and are of unknown functional significance, similar alterations have been previously reported in the context of cancer, which may indicate biological relevance. In the TCGA datasets, KIT amplification has been reported in 2.5% of lower grade gliomas (grades 2 and 3)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26061751) and 9.2% of glioblastomas (Grade 4 astrocytoma)(cBio-Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142). KIT amplification has been variously reported in 4-47% of glioblastomas in the scientific literature (Nobusawa et al., 2011; 21382095, Joensuu et al., 2005; 16021678, Burford et al., 2013; 23990986). Amplification of KIT has been strongly correlated with the presence of KDR and/or PDGFRA amplification in glioblastoma (Joensuu et al., 2005; 16021678, Holtkamp et al., 2007; 17504929, Puputti et al., 2006; 17189383). In the glioblastoma multiforme TCGA dataset, KIT mutation has been observed in 1.1% of cases (cBio-Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142). KIT alterations have been correlated with lower median OS compared with KIT wildtype for patients with gliomas (21.6 vs. 37.6 months), including astrocytomas (33.2 vs. 58.6 months) (Guo et al., 2023; 36998447). One study found no correlation between KIT amplification and OS for patients with glioblastoma (GBM), while a separate study reported that overexpression of KIT was associated with tumor grade and shorter survival for patients with malignant glioma (Nobusawa et al., 2011; 21382095, Skardelly et al., 2009; 19701495). On the basis of clinical evidence, primarily in gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), melanoma, AML, and systemic mastocytosis, KIT activating alterations are associated with sensitivity to TKIs including imatinib, sunitinib, sorafenib, dasatinib, nilotinib, pazopanib, regorafenib, ponatinib, midostaurin, apatinib, avapritinib, and ripretinib (Heinrich et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 10506, Heinrich et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 11011, DeAngelo et al., 2017; ASH Abstract 2, Evans et al., 2017; 29093181, Abbaspour Babaei et al., 2016; 27536065, Ramaswamy et al., 2016; 27563456, Demetri et al., 2013; 23177515, Gotlib et al., 2016; 27355533, Jawhar et al., 2017; 28424161, Xu et al., 2014; 25031773, Gotlib et al., 2005; 15972446, George et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 11511, Luo et al., 2017; 29066909, Janku et al., 2022; 35753087, Kim et al., 2022; ENA Abstract 237). The use of mTOR inhibitors as an alternative therapeutic strategy has demonstrated limited success in KIT-mutated, imatinib-resistant melanoma, with 1 PR and 3 SD observed for 4 patients treated with everolimus (Si et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract 8562, Si et al., 2012; 22162580). However, no responses were observed for 10 patients with mastocytosis following everolimus monotherapy, with 8/10 patients harboring the KIT D816V mutation (Parikh et al., 2010; 20038218). The role of KIT amplification as a biomarker for response to mTOR inhibitors has not been investigated (PubMed, Feb 2023). Clinical benefit has been observed for patients with KIT amplified or overexpressing tumors following treatment with imatinib (Wei et al., 2019; 30075827, Hodi et al., 2013; 23775962, Carvajal et al., 2011; 21642685, Guo et al., 2011; 21690468, Debiec-Rychter et al., 2005; 15685537, DeMatteo et al., 2009; 19303137, Faivre et al., 2005; 16135502, Hotte et al., 2005; 15659505, Alcedo et al., 2004; 15350030, Brandwein et al., 2011; 21403650, Reardon et al., 2009; 19904263), nilotinib (Lee et al., 2015; 26424760), sorafenib (Llovet et al., 2012; 22374331, Zhang et al., 2013; 23058498, Seino et al., 2014; 25450081, Li et al., 2009; 18846437), and sunitinib (Minor et al., 2012; 22261812, Mahipal et al., 2012; 23114504), suggesting that KIT amplification may be sensitive to these inhibitors. However, evidence demonstrating clinical benefit for regorafenib, dasatinib, pazopanib, or ponatinib in the context of KIT amplified or overexpressing tumors is limited.</Interpretation>
              <Include>true</Include>
              <ClinicalTrialNote>KIT amplification or activating mutations may predict sensitivity to small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Also, because KIT activation leads to activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, PI3K and mTOR pathway inhibitors may be relevant in a tumor with KIT activation.</ClinicalTrialNote>

                  <Rationale>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Approved Indications:&lt;/b&gt; Nilotinib targets tyrosine kinases such as ABL (including BCR-ABL), PDGFRs, KIT, CSF1R, DDR1, and DDR2. It is FDA approved to treat newly diagnosed pediatric or adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase, adults with Ph+ CML in chronic or accelerated phase with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy including imatinib, and pediatric patients with Ph+ CML in chronic phase with resistance or intolerance to prior tyrosine-kinase inhibitor therapy. Please see the drug label for full prescribing information. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gene Association:&lt;/b&gt; On the basis of clinical and preclinical data in KIT-mutated (Lee et al., 2015; 26424760, Carvajal et al., 2015; 25695690, Hochhaus et al., 2015; 26002753, Blay et al., 2015; 25882987, Kaijimoto et al., 2015; 26722383), KIT-amplified (Lee et al., 2015; 26424760), or KIT-expressing tumors (Sako et al., 2014; 25221952), KIT activating alterations may confer sensitivity to nilotinib. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supporting Data:&lt;/b&gt; Clinical data on the efficacy of nilotinib for the treatment of CNS tumors are limited (PubMed, Jan 2024). Nilotinib has been primarily investigated as a therapeutic option for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). In the context of CML, a Phase 3 clinical trial for patients who are Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) positive treated with imatinib or nilotinib (300 or 400 mg) reported PFS rates of 93% and 97-98% and OS rates of 93% and 94-97%, respectively, at 4 years (Hughes et al., 2014; 24335106). For Japanese patients with CML who are resistant to imatinib, a Phase 2 trial reported a 49% major medical response rate to treatment with nilotinib at 12 months (Takahashi et al., 2014; 24650752). A Phase 3 clinical trial of single-agent nilotinib in 240 patients with advanced GIST who failed prior treatment with imatinib or sunitinib reported no significant difference in PFS between nilotinib and the best supportive care but did report increased OS for patients treated with nilotinib (Reichardt et al., 2012; 22357255). A Phase 2 trial has shown that nilotinib was well tolerated and suggested it may be particularly useful for treating patients with GIST harboring mutations in KIT exon 17 (Cauchi et al., 2012; 22119758). &lt;/p&gt;</Rationale>

A Phase 2 trial that examined sunitinib treatment followed by radiation therapy for patients with GBM reported a median PFS of 7.7 weeks and a median OS of 12.8 weeks; 83% (10/12) of patients experienced neurological deterioration prior to radiation therapy (Balana et al., 2014; 24424564). Another Phase 2 study that examined daily sunitinib treatment for patients with GBM reported no objective response for any of the 40 patients, with a median PFS of 2.2 months and a median OS of 9.2 months; 5 patients in the study had SD for &gt;6 months (Hutterer et al., 2014; 24311637). &lt;/p&gt;</Rationale>

On the basis of clinical responses in patients with GIST, PDGFRA activating mutations may predict sensitivity to sorafenib (Fumagalli et al., 2012; ESMO Abstract 1491P)(Roubaud et al., 2012; 22294526). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supporting Data:&lt;/b&gt; Phase 2 studies of sorafenib plus temozolomide report limited activity for patients with relapsed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (Zustovich et al., 2013; 23898124; Reardon et al., 2011; 20443129). A Phase 1/2 trial of temsirolimus in combination with sorafenib for patients with glioblastoma was terminated at the Phase 2 interim analysis after patients failed to meet the primary endpoint of 6-month PFS (Lee et al., 2012; 23099651). A Phase 2 trial of sorafenib and erlotinib in glioblastoma also did not meet its primary endpoint, and erlotinib clearance was increased by the addition of sorafenib (Peereboom et al., 2013; 23328813). In a Phase 1 trial for patients with high-grade glioma, the combination of sorafenib with radiation therapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ) resulted in increased toxicity and did not result in significant improvement in clinical efficacy compared with RT and TMZ alone (Hottinger et al., 2014; 24786603). In a clinical study of sorafenib for pediatric patients with low-grade astrocytoma, 1 patient achieved a PR, 1 had SD, and 9 patients had progressive disease; this study was terminated early due to unexpectedly high disease progression rates (Karajannis et al., 2014; 24803676). &lt;/p&gt;</Rationale>

On the basis of strong clinical evidence, PDGFRA activating mutations (Cassier et al., 2012; 22718859, Dileo et al., 2011; 20473908, Fanta et al., 2015; 24638008, Heinrich et al., 2003; 14645423, Yoo et al., 2016; 26130666), fusions (Baccarani et al., 2007; 17666373, Curtis et al., 2007; 17555450, Griffin et al., 2003; 12808148, Helbig et al., 2009; 19120352, Klion et al., 2004; 14504092, Qu et al., 2016; 27120808, Metzgeroth et al., 2007; 17377585, Metzgeroth et al., 2008; 18950453, Ogbogu et al., 2009; 19910029, Sugimoto et al., 2015; 26319757), and expression (Frenard et al., 2016; 27051816) may predict sensitivity to imatinib. PDGFRA amplification may predict sensitivity to TKIs such as imatinib; a patient with Merkel cell carcinoma expressing PDGFRA achieved a CR to imatinib (Frenard et al., 2016; 27051816). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supporting Data:&lt;/b&gt; In a clinical study where patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) were given imatinib, 8.3% (2/24) of patients achieved a PR, 10 patients reported SD, and median OS and median PFS were observed to be 6.2 and 3 months, respectively (Hassler et al., 2014; 25674429). However, other Phase 2 clinical trials of imatinib have reported no antitumor activity, with a study of 231 patients with GBM reporting a radiographic response rate of only 3.4% (Razis et al., 2009; 19789313, Reardon et al., 2009; 19904263, Sautter et al., 2022; 31514200). In another Phase 2 study, imatinib plus hydroxyurea was shown to be well tolerated among patients with recurrent/progressive low-grade glioma but had negligible antitumor activity (Reardon et al., 2012; 22371319). &lt;/p&gt;</Rationale>

              <Interpretation>KIT (also called c-KIT) encodes a cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor that, upon ligand binding and dimerization, activates the PI3K-AKT and RAS-MAPK signaling pathways (Linnekin, 1999; 10582339). KIT aberrations, including point mutations, translocations, amplification, and overexpression, have been associated with various malignancies, and KIT is considered an oncoprotein (Fletcher, 2004; 15175998). KIT has been reported to be amplified in cancer (Gao et al., 2013; 23550210) and may be biologically relevant in this context (Zack et al., 2013; 24071852, Beroukhim et al., 2010; 20164920). Although alterations such as seen here have not been fully characterized and are of unknown functional significance, similar alterations have been previously reported in the context of cancer, which may indicate biological relevance. In the TCGA datasets, KIT amplification has been reported in 2.5% of lower grade gliomas (grades 2 and 3)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26061751) and 9.2% of glioblastomas (Grade 4 astrocytoma)(cBio-Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142). KIT amplification has been variously reported in 4-47% of glioblastomas in the scientific literature (Nobusawa et al., 2011; 21382095, Joensuu et al., 2005; 16021678, Burford et al., 2013; 23990986). Amplification of KIT has been strongly correlated with the presence of KDR and/or PDGFRA amplification in glioblastoma (Joensuu et al., 2005; 16021678, Holtkamp et al., 2007; 17504929, Puputti et al., 2006; 17189383). In the glioblastoma multiforme TCGA dataset, KIT mutation has been observed in 1.1% of cases (cBio-Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142). KIT alterations have been correlated with lower median OS compared with KIT wildtype for patients with gliomas (21.6 vs. 37.6 months), including astrocytomas (33.2 vs. 58.6 months) (Guo et al., 2023; 36998447). One study found no correlation between KIT amplification and OS for patients with glioblastoma (GBM), while a separate study reported that overexpression of KIT was associated with tumor grade and shorter survival for patients with malignant glioma (Nobusawa et al., 2011; 21382095, Skardelly et al., 2009; 19701495). On the basis of clinical evidence, primarily in gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), melanoma, AML, and systemic mastocytosis, KIT activating alterations are associated with sensitivity to TKIs including imatinib, sunitinib, sorafenib, dasatinib, nilotinib, pazopanib, regorafenib, ponatinib, midostaurin, apatinib, avapritinib, and ripretinib (Heinrich et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 10506, Heinrich et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 11011, DeAngelo et al., 2017; ASH Abstract 2, Evans et al., 2017; 29093181, Abbaspour Babaei et al., 2016; 27536065, Ramaswamy et al., 2016; 27563456, Demetri et al., 2013; 23177515, Gotlib et al., 2016; 27355533, Jawhar et al., 2017; 28424161, Xu et al., 2014; 25031773, Gotlib et al., 2005; 15972446, George et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 11511, Luo et al., 2017; 29066909, Janku et al., 2022; 35753087, Kim et al., 2022; ENA Abstract 237). The use of mTOR inhibitors as an alternative therapeutic strategy has demonstrated limited success in KIT-mutated, imatinib-resistant melanoma, with 1 PR and 3 SD observed for 4 patients treated with everolimus (Si et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract 8562, Si et al., 2012; 22162580). However, no responses were observed for 10 patients with mastocytosis following everolimus monotherapy, with 8/10 patients harboring the KIT D816V mutation (Parikh et al., 2010; 20038218). The role of KIT amplification as a biomarker for response to mTOR inhibitors has not been investigated (PubMed, Feb 2023). Clinical benefit has been observed for patients with KIT amplified or overexpressing tumors following treatment with imatinib (Wei et al., 2019; 30075827, Hodi et al., 2013; 23775962, Carvajal et al., 2011; 21642685, Guo et al., 2011; 21690468, Debiec-Rychter et al., 2005; 15685537, DeMatteo et al., 2009; 19303137, Faivre et al., 2005; 16135502, Hotte et al., 2005; 15659505, Alcedo et al., 2004; 15350030, Brandwein et al., 2011; 21403650, Reardon et al., 2009; 19904263), nilotinib (Lee et al., 2015; 26424760), sorafenib (Llovet et al., 2012; 22374331, Zhang et al., 2013; 23058498, Seino et al., 2014; 25450081, Li et al., 2009; 18846437), and sunitinib (Minor et al., 2012; 22261812, Mahipal et al., 2012; 23114504), suggesting that KIT amplification may be sensitive to these inhibitors. However, evidence demonstrating clinical benefit for regorafenib, dasatinib, pazopanib, or ponatinib in the context of KIT amplified or overexpressing tumors is limited.</Interpretation>
              <Include>true</Include>
              <ClinicalTrialNote>KIT amplification or activating mutations may predict sensitivity to small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Also, because KIT activation leads to activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, PI3K and mTOR pathway inhibitors may be relevant in a tumor with KIT activation.</ClinicalTrialNote>

Nilotinib has been primarily investigated as a therapeutic option for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). In the context of CML, a Phase 3 clinical trial for patients who are Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) positive treated with imatinib or nilotinib (300 or 400 mg) reported PFS rates of 93% and 97-98% and OS rates of 93% and 94-97%, respectively, at 4 years (Hughes et al., 2014; 24335106). For Japanese patients with CML who are resistant to imatinib, a Phase 2 trial reported a 49% major medical response rate to treatment with nilotinib at 12 months (Takahashi et al., 2014; 24650752). A Phase 3 clinical trial of single-agent nilotinib in 240 patients with advanced GIST who failed prior treatment with imatinib or sunitinib reported no significant difference in PFS between nilotinib and the best supportive care but did report increased OS for patients treated with nilotinib (Reichardt et al., 2012; 22357255). A Phase 2 trial has shown that nilotinib was well tolerated and suggested it may be particularly useful for treating patients with GIST harboring mutations in KIT exon 17 (Cauchi et al., 2012; 22119758). &lt;/p&gt;</Rationale>

On the basis of clinical responses in patients with GIST, PDGFRA activating mutations may predict sensitivity to sorafenib (Fumagalli et al., 2012; ESMO Abstract 1491P)(Roubaud et al., 2012; 22294526). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supporting Data:&lt;/b&gt; Phase 2 studies of sorafenib plus temozolomide report limited activity for patients with relapsed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (Zustovich et al., 2013; 23898124; Reardon et al., 2011; 20443129). A Phase 1/2 trial of temsirolimus in combination with sorafenib for patients with glioblastoma was terminated at the Phase 2 interim analysis after patients failed to meet the primary endpoint of 6-month PFS (Lee et al., 2012; 23099651). A Phase 2 trial of sorafenib and erlotinib in glioblastoma also did not meet its primary endpoint, and erlotinib clearance was increased by the addition of sorafenib (Peereboom et al., 2013; 23328813). In a Phase 1 trial for patients with high-grade glioma, the combination of sorafenib with radiation therapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ) resulted in increased toxicity and did not result in significant improvement in clinical efficacy compared with RT and TMZ alone (Hottinger et al., 2014; 24786603). In a clinical study of sorafenib for pediatric patients with low-grade astrocytoma, 1 patient achieved a PR, 1 had SD, and 9 patients had progressive disease; this study was terminated early due to unexpectedly high disease progression rates (Karajannis et al., 2014; 24803676). &lt;/p&gt;</Rationale>

On the basis of strong clinical evidence, PDGFRA activating mutations (Cassier et al., 2012; 22718859, Dileo et al., 2011; 20473908, Fanta et al., 2015; 24638008, Heinrich et al., 2003; 14645423, Yoo et al., 2016; 26130666), fusions (Baccarani et al., 2007; 17666373, Curtis et al., 2007; 17555450, Griffin et al., 2003; 12808148, Helbig et al., 2009; 19120352, Klion et al., 2004; 14504092, Qu et al., 2016; 27120808, Metzgeroth et al., 2007; 17377585, Metzgeroth et al., 2008; 18950453, Ogbogu et al., 2009; 19910029, Sugimoto et al., 2015; 26319757), and expression (Frenard et al., 2016; 27051816) may predict sensitivity to imatinib. PDGFRA amplification may predict sensitivity to TKIs such as imatinib; a patient with Merkel cell carcinoma expressing PDGFRA achieved a CR to imatinib (Frenard et al., 2016; 27051816). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supporting Data:&lt;/b&gt; In a clinical study where patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) were given imatinib, 8.3% (2/24) of patients achieved a PR, 10 patients reported SD, and median OS and median PFS were observed to be 6.2 and 3 months, respectively (Hassler et al., 2014; 25674429). However, other Phase 2 clinical trials of imatinib have reported no antitumor activity, with a study of 231 patients with GBM reporting a radiographic response rate of only 3.4% (Razis et al., 2009; 19789313, Reardon et al., 2009; 19904263, Sautter et al., 2022; 31514200). In another Phase 2 study, imatinib plus hydroxyurea was shown to be well tolerated among patients with recurrent/progressive low-grade glioma but had negligible antitumor activity (Reardon et al., 2012; 22371319). &lt;/p&gt;</Rationale>

              <Interpretation>PDGFRA encodes platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR-alpha), a tyrosine kinase receptor that, upon binding of cognate ligands (PDGFA or PDGFB), activates several signaling pathways, including PI3K and MAPK (Andrae et al., 2008; 18483217). PDGFR aberrations, including point mutations, translocations, amplification, and/or overexpression, have been associated with various malignancies (Fletcher, 2004; 15175998). Amplification of PDGFRA, frequently occurring with amplification of the genes KDR and KIT, has been associated with increased PDGFRA expression (Burford et al., 2013; 23990986, Flavahan et al., 2016; 26700815, Roszik et al., 2016; 26787600, Verhaak et al., 2010; 20129251) and poor prognosis (Burford et al., 2013; 23990986, Koschmann et al., 2016; 27582545, Phillips et al., 2013; 23438035, Puget et al., 2012; 22389665) in some subtypes of glioma. The PDGFRA rearrangement in this tumor results in deletion of exons 8-9. The PDGFRA exon 8-9 deletion mutation was demonstrated to be active in the absence of ligand and has been characterized as transforming (Clarke et al., 2003; 12569364, Ozawa et al., 2010; 20889717). This mutation was sensitive to imatinib and the kinase inhibitor vatalanib (Ozawa et al., 2010; 20889717). PDGFRA amplification has been suggested to be more common in higher grade astrocytomas than in lower grade astrocytomas; studies have reported PDGFRA amplification in 16.3% (27/166) of Grade 2 astrocytomas and in 23.6% (91/386) of Grade 3 and 4 astrocytomas analyzed (Holtkamp et al., 2007; 17504929, Phillips et al., 2013; 23438035, Motomura et al., 2013; 23242283). PDGFRA amplification has been reported in 5.2-33% of glioblastoma cases (cBio-Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, Phillips et al., 2013; 23438035, Sottoriva et al., 2013; 23412337, Nobusawa et al., 2011; 21382095, Joensuu et al., 2005; 16021678, Alentorn et al., 2012; 23074200). PDGFRA mutations have been reported in 0-6% of low-grade glioma, high-grade glioma, and glioblastoma samples (cBio-Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2008; 18772890, cBio-Hoadley et al., 2018; 29625048, cBio-Ellrott et al., 2018; 29596782, cBio-Taylor et al., 2018; 29622463, cBio-Gao et al., 2018; 29617662, cBio-Liu et al., 2018; 29625055, cBio-Sanchez-Vega et al., 2018; 29625050, Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2015; 26061751, cBio-Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, cBio-Thomas et al., 2017; 28472509, cBio-Jones et al., 2013; 23817572). A retrospective analysis of TCGA glioma samples reported elevated expression of ERBB3 correlated with PDGFRA expression and co-expression of these genes was an indicator of poor prognosis in a GBM patient cohort (Song et al., 2018; 29888103). PDGFRA amplification has been associated with tumor grade and poor PFS and OS for patients with glioblastoma (Alentorn et al., 2012; 23074200, Sottoriva et al., 2013; 23412337, Phillips et al., 2013; 23438035). In addition, PDGFRA amplification has been reported to occur in conjunction with IDH1 mutations in glioblastoma, and both alterations in the same tumor have been associated with poor patient prognosis (Phillips et al., 2013; 23438035). Amplification of PDGFRA has also been strongly correlated with the presence of KDR and/or KIT amplification in glioblastomas, as well as with EGFR amplification (Joensuu et al., 2005; 16021678, Holtkamp et al., 2007; 17504929, Puputti et al., 2006; 17189383, Szerlip et al., 2012; 22323597). Based on extensive clinical evidence in gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) (Cassier et al., 2012; 22718859, Debiec-Rychter et al., 2016; 15010069, Dileo et al., 2011; 20473908, Fanta et al., 2015; 24638008, Heinrich et al., 2003; 14645423, Kang et al., 2012; 22150077, Kocakova et al., 2014; 24635438, Murayama et al., 2012; 22645636, Yoo et al., 2016; 26130666) and limited preclinical evidence (Ozawa et al., 2010; 20889717, Velghe et al., 2014; 23752188, Elling et al., 2011; 21224473), PDGFRA activating mutations are associated with sensitivity to imatinib. Sorafenib has shown clinical and preclinical activity against PDGFRA mutations associated with clinical resistance to imatinib and sunitinib both in GIST and in the context of FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion in chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL)(Fumagalli et al., 2012; ESMO Abstract 1491P, Al-Riyami et al., 2013; 23157309, Lierman et al., 2006; 16645167, Lierman et al., 2009; 19212337, Metzgeroth et al., 2012; 21818111, Roubaud et al., 2012; 22294526, Von Bubnoff et al., 2011; 20972453). Clinical benefit from nilotinib has been reported for individual patients with CEL with activating PDGFRA mutations (Hochhaus et al., 2013; 24057647); preclinical evidence has also suggested efficacy of nilotinib in the context of PDGFRA mutations associated with GIST (Dewaele et al., 2008; 18794084, Weisberg et al., 2006; 17087936). Patients with GIST harboring PDGFRA activating mutations have been reported to derive clinical benefit from treatment with sunitinib (Heinrich et al., 2006; ASCO Abstract 9502, Brohl et al., 2015; 26396737) or regorafenib (Grellety et al., 2015; 28031906, Kollar et al., 2014; 25905001). PDGFRA D842 mutations were reported to be sensitive to avapritinib in clinical (Heinrich et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 11011, Evans et al., 2017; 29093181) and preclinical (Evans et al., 2017; 29093181) studies of GIST, and demonstrated sensitivity to ripretinib for 1 patient (Jaku et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 2515). Preclinical and limited clinical evidence support sensitivity of PDGFRA mutations to crenolanib (Heinrich et al., 2012; 22745105, Paugh et al., 2013; 23970477, Dai et al., 2013; 24132921, von Mehren et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 11010, Matro et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 10546). Preclinical evidence suggests sensitivity of PDGFRA mutations to dasatinib (Dewaele et al., 2008; 18794084, Lierman et al., 2009; 19212337) and midostaurin (Cools et al., 2003; 12781364, Cools et al., 2004; 14630792, Sadovnik et al., 2014; 24407160) in the context of GIST and FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusions in CEL. On the basis of limited evidence of clinical benefit for patients with increased PDGFR expression, PDGFRA amplification may be associated with sensitivity to imatinib (Frenard et al., 2016; 27051816, Geoerger et al., 2009; 19362466).</Interpretation>

              <Interpretation>PDGFRA encodes platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR-alpha), a tyrosine kinase receptor that, upon binding of cognate ligands (PDGFA or PDGFB), activates several signaling pathways, including PI3K and MAPK (Andrae et al., 2008; 18483217). PDGFR aberrations, including point mutations, translocations, amplification, and/or overexpression, have been associated with various malignancies (Fletcher, 2004; 15175998). Amplification of PDGFRA, frequently occurring with amplification of the genes KDR and KIT, has been associated with increased PDGFRA expression (Burford et al., 2013; 23990986, Flavahan et al., 2016; 26700815, Roszik et al., 2016; 26787600, Verhaak et al., 2010; 20129251) and poor prognosis (Burford et al., 2013; 23990986, Koschmann et al., 2016; 27582545, Phillips et al., 2013; 23438035, Puget et al., 2012; 22389665) in some subtypes of glioma. The PDGFRA rearrangement in this tumor results in deletion of exons 8-9. The PDGFRA exon 8-9 deletion mutation was demonstrated to be active in the absence of ligand and has been characterized as transforming (Clarke et al., 2003; 12569364, Ozawa et al., 2010; 20889717). This mutation was sensitive to imatinib and the kinase inhibitor vatalanib (Ozawa et al., 2010; 20889717). PDGFRA amplification has been suggested to be more common in higher grade astrocytomas than in lower grade astrocytomas; studies have reported PDGFRA amplification in 16.3% (27/166) of Grade 2 astrocytomas and in 23.6% (91/386) of Grade 3 and 4 astrocytomas analyzed (Holtkamp et al., 2007; 17504929, Phillips et al., 2013; 23438035, Motomura et al., 2013; 23242283). PDGFRA amplification has been reported in 5.2-33% of glioblastoma cases (cBio-Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, Phillips et al., 2013; 23438035, Sottoriva et al., 2013; 23412337, Nobusawa et al., 2011; 21382095, Joensuu et al., 2005; 16021678, Alentorn et al., 2012; 23074200). PDGFRA mutations have been reported in 0-6% of low-grade glioma, high-grade glioma, and glioblastoma samples (cBio-Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2008; 18772890, cBio-Hoadley et al., 2018; 29625048, cBio-Ellrott et al., 2018; 29596782, cBio-Taylor et al., 2018; 29622463, cBio-Gao et al., 2018; 29617662, cBio-Liu et al., 2018; 29625055, cBio-Sanchez-Vega et al., 2018; 29625050, Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2015; 26061751, cBio-Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, cBio-Thomas et al., 2017; 28472509, cBio-Jones et al., 2013; 23817572). A retrospective analysis of TCGA glioma samples reported elevated expression of ERBB3 correlated with PDGFRA expression and co-expression of these genes was an indicator of poor prognosis in a GBM patient cohort (Song et al., 2018; 29888103). PDGFRA amplification has been associated with tumor grade and poor PFS and OS for patients with glioblastoma (Alentorn et al., 2012; 23074200, Sottoriva et al., 2013; 23412337, Phillips et al., 2013; 23438035). In addition, PDGFRA amplification has been reported to occur in conjunction with IDH1 mutations in glioblastoma, and both alterations in the same tumor have been associated with poor patient prognosis (Phillips et al., 2013; 23438035). Amplification of PDGFRA has also been strongly correlated with the presence of KDR and/or KIT amplification in glioblastomas, as well as with EGFR amplification (Joensuu et al., 2005; 16021678, Holtkamp et al., 2007; 17504929, Puputti et al., 2006; 17189383, Szerlip et al., 2012; 22323597). Based on extensive clinical evidence in gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) (Cassier et al., 2012; 22718859, Debiec-Rychter et al., 2016; 15010069, Dileo et al., 2011; 20473908, Fanta et al., 2015; 24638008, Heinrich et al., 2003; 14645423, Kang et al., 2012; 22150077, Kocakova et al., 2014; 24635438, Murayama et al., 2012; 22645636, Yoo et al., 2016; 26130666) and limited preclinical evidence (Ozawa et al., 2010; 20889717, Velghe et al., 2014; 23752188, Elling et al., 2011; 21224473), PDGFRA activating mutations are associated with sensitivity to imatinib. Sorafenib has shown clinical and preclinical activity against PDGFRA mutations associated with clinical resistance to imatinib and sunitinib both in GIST and in the context of FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion in chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL)(Fumagalli et al., 2012; ESMO Abstract 1491P, Al-Riyami et al., 2013; 23157309, Lierman et al., 2006; 16645167, Lierman et al., 2009; 19212337, Metzgeroth et al., 2012; 21818111, Roubaud et al., 2012; 22294526, Von Bubnoff et al., 2011; 20972453). Clinical benefit from nilotinib has been reported for individual patients with CEL with activating PDGFRA mutations (Hochhaus et al., 2013; 24057647); preclinical evidence has also suggested efficacy of nilotinib in the context of PDGFRA mutations associated with GIST (Dewaele et al., 2008; 18794084, Weisberg et al., 2006; 17087936). Patients with GIST harboring PDGFRA activating mutations have been reported to derive clinical benefit from treatment with sunitinib (Heinrich et al., 2006; ASCO Abstract 9502, Brohl et al., 2015; 26396737) or regorafenib (Grellety et al., 2015; 28031906, Kollar et al., 2014; 25905001). PDGFRA D842 mutations were reported to be sensitive to avapritinib in clinical (Heinrich et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 11011, Evans et al., 2017; 29093181) and preclinical (Evans et al., 2017; 29093181) studies of GIST, and demonstrated sensitivity to ripretinib for 1 patient (Jaku et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 2515). Preclinical and limited clinical evidence support sensitivity of PDGFRA mutations to crenolanib (Heinrich et al., 2012; 22745105, Paugh et al., 2013; 23970477, Dai et al., 2013; 24132921, von Mehren et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 11010, Matro et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 10546). Preclinical evidence suggests sensitivity of PDGFRA mutations to dasatinib (Dewaele et al., 2008; 18794084, Lierman et al., 2009; 19212337) and midostaurin (Cools et al., 2003; 12781364, Cools et al., 2004; 14630792, Sadovnik et al., 2014; 24407160) in the context of GIST and FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusions in CEL. On the basis of limited evidence of clinical benefit for patients with increased PDGFR expression, PDGFRA amplification may be associated with sensitivity to imatinib (Frenard et al., 2016; 27051816, Geoerger et al., 2009; 19362466).</Interpretation>

On the basis of clinical responses in patients with GIST, PDGFRA activating mutations may predict sensitivity to sorafenib (Fumagalli et al., 2012; ESMO Abstract 1491P)(Roubaud et al., 2012; 22294526). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supporting Data:&lt;/b&gt; Phase 2 studies of sorafenib plus temozolomide report limited activity for patients with relapsed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (Zustovich et al., 2013; 23898124; Reardon et al., 2011; 20443129). A Phase 1/2 trial of temsirolimus in combination with sorafenib for patients with glioblastoma was terminated at the Phase 2 interim analysis after patients failed to meet the primary endpoint of 6-month PFS (Lee et al., 2012; 23099651). A Phase 2 trial of sorafenib and erlotinib in glioblastoma also did not meet its primary endpoint, and erlotinib clearance was increased by the addition of sorafenib (Peereboom et al., 2013; 23328813). In a Phase 1 trial for patients with high-grade glioma, the combination of sorafenib with radiation therapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ) resulted in increased toxicity and did not result in significant improvement in clinical efficacy compared with RT and TMZ alone (Hottinger et al., 2014; 24786603). In a clinical study of sorafenib for pediatric patients with low-grade astrocytoma, 1 patient achieved a PR, 1 had SD, and 9 patients had progressive disease; this study was terminated early due to unexpectedly high disease progression rates (Karajannis et al., 2014; 24803676). &lt;/p&gt;</Rationale>

              <Interpretation>PIK3CA encodes p110-alpha, which is the catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). The PI3K pathway is involved in cell signaling that regulates a number of critical cellular functions, including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, motility, and survival (Samuels et al., 2005; 15950905, Engelman, 2009; 19629070). PIK3CA alterations that have been characterized as activating, such as observed here, are predicted to be oncogenic (Kang et al., 2005; 15647370, Ikenoue et al., 2005; 15930273, Gymnopoulos et al., 2007; 17376864, Horn et al., 2008; 18317450, Rudd et al., 2011; 21266528, Hon et al., 2012; 22120714, Burke et al., 2012; 22949682, Wu et al., 2009; 19915146, Dbouk et al., 2010; 2103068, Dan et al., 2010; 20530683, Oda et al., 2008; 18829572, Zhao and Vogt, 2008; 18794883, Lui et al., 2013; 23619167, Ross et al., 2013; 22430209, Riviere et al., 2012; 22729224, Shibata et al., 2009; 19394761, Droguluk et al., 2015; 26627007, Croessmann et al., 2018; 29284706, Ng et al., 2018; 29533785, Spangle et al., 2020; 32929011, Chen et al., 2018; 29636477, Jin et al., 2021; 34779417). PIK3CA mutations have been reported in 9% of glioblastoma (GBM) samples analyzed in the TCGA dataset (cBio-Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142), and other studies report the incidence of PIK3CA mutations in primary GBMs as 5-18% (Gallia et al., 2006; 17050665, Broderick et al., 2004; 15289301, El-Habr et al., 2010; 20569675). One study detected PIK3CA mutation in 16% (36/232) of IDH-wildtype GBM samples analyzed (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). PIK3CA mutations have been reported in 5-23% of high-grade gliomas (including glioblastomas, anaplastic astrocytomas, and anaplastic oligodendrogliomas) (El-Habr et al., 2010; 20569675, Gallia et al., 2006; 17050665, Broderick et al., 2004; 15289301, Derakhshandeh-Peykar et al., 2011; 22026810, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2008; 18772890). While another study did not observe PIK3CA mutations in low-grade astrocytomas or in anaplastic astrocytomas, it did report high ERK and AKT activity (El-Habr et al., 2010; 20569675). One study found that PIK3CA mutation in glioblastoma (GBM) was associated with shorter median PFS in both a discovery cohort (6.9 vs. 12.4 months, HR=2.89, p=0.01) and in the TCGA cohort (6.1 vs. 9 months, p=0.008), but was not consistently associated with median OS (Tanaka et al., 2019; 31036078). In a study of IDH-wildtype GBM, patients with alterations in PI3K class I genes (PIK3CA, PIK3R1, PIK3CG, and PIK3R2) had significantly longer OS (20.0 months altered vs. 16.9 months wildtype, HR=0.62, p=0.002) and PFS (11.0 months altered vs. 7.4 months wildtype, p=0.0043); patients with PIK3CA alterations experienced an improved OS but this association was not highly significant (20.0 months altered vs. 18.1 months wildtype, p=0.0407)(Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). Clinical and preclinical data in various tumor types indicate that PIK3CA activating alterations may predict sensitivity to therapies targeting PI3K (Fritsch et al., 2014; 24608574, Juric et al., 2018; 29401002, Gallant et al., 2019; 30793038, Canaud et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract LBA23, Delestre et al., 2021; 34613809, Morschhauser et al., 2020; 31619463, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108, Santin et al., 2020; 31934607, Damodaran et al., 2022; 35133871, Varkaris et al., 2023; 37916956), AKT (Andre et al., 2019; 31091374, Smyth et al., 2021; 33863913), or mTOR (Varnier et al., 2019; 31351267, Basse et al., 2018; 32914004, Sultova et al., 2021; 33277683, Mackay et al., 2014; 24166148, Myers et al., 2016; 27016228, Dhami et al., 2018; 29588307, Harris et al., 2019; 30863722, Hanna et al., 2018; 29301825). The Phase 2 NCI-MATCH study of copanlisib for patients with refractory solid tumors harboring PIK3CA mutations with or without PTEN loss met its primary endpoint with an ORR of 16% (4/25 PRs); responses (PR or SD &gt;6 months) were seen in patients with ameloblastoma, liposarcoma, and carcinomas of the endometrium, ovary, esophagus, lung, and prostate (Damodaran et al., 2022; 35133871). However, the Phase 2 study of copanlisib for patients with endometrial carcinoma harboring PIK3CA hotspot mutations failed to report any objective responses (n=11)(Santin et al., 2020; 31934607). Two other studies of copanlisib for patients with genomically unselected tumors reported 1 CR and 2 PRs (1 unconfirmed) among 16 total patients with PIK3CA-mutated solid tumors with or without PTEN alterations (Morschhauser et al., 2020; 31619463, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108). In the Phase 2 MATCH trial for patients with PIK3CA-mutated solid tumors, 28% (18/65) of patients experienced PFS lasting at least 6 months after treatment with taselisib; however, no ORs were observed in this study (Krop et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 101). A separate Phase 1b study of taselisib in combination with the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib for patients with PIK3CA-mutated solid tumors reported an ORR of 0% (n=12) and a DCR of 17% (2/12) (Pascual et al., 2021; 32958578). In a Phase 1 trial of the dual PI3K/mTOR kinase inhibitor apitolisib, 79% (11/14) of patients with PIK3CA-mutated advanced solid tumors experienced disease control (3 PRs, 8 SDs) (Dolly et al., 2016; 26787751). The PI3K inhibitor alpelisib is approved as a single agent for the treatment of patients with PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS) (Canaud et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract LBA23), but has shown limited activity as monotherapy for PIK3CA-mutated solid tumors with a Phase 1a study reporting an ORR of 6.0% (8/134) and a DCR of 58% (78/134) (Juric et al., 2018; 29401002).</Interpretation>
              <Include>true</Include>
              <ClinicalTrialNote>PIK3CA activating mutations may lead to activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway and may therefore indicate sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway. Strong clinical data support sensitivity of PIK3CA-mutated solid tumors to the PI3K-alpha inhibitor alpelisib.</ClinicalTrialNote>

              <Interpretation>Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA MMR in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite-stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). Low-level MSI has been reported in 5-9% of glioblastoma (GBM) samples (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927, Martinez et al., 2005; 15672285, Martinez et al., 2007; 17498554). A large-scale study did not find high-level microsatellite instability (MSI-H) in any of 129 GBM samples (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927), although a small-scale study reported MSI-H in 4 of 15 pediatric GBMs and 1 of 12 adult GBMs (Szybka et al., 2003; 12908754). The frequency of microsatellite instability (MSI) has been reported to be increased in relapsed compared with primary glioblastoma (GBM) (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927), in GBMs with a previous lower-grade astrocytoma (Martinez et al., 2005; 15672285), and in giant cell GBM compared with classic GBM (Martinez et al., 2007; 17498554). Acquired MMR deficiency has been reported as a potential resistance mechanism to temozolomide, and patients with glioma and MMR deficiency showed poor survival outcomes (Touat et al., 2020; 3232206, Lombardi et al., 2020; 32823925). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI-H tumors to respond to anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI-H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non-MSI-H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO-SITC Abstract P60). Preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that acquired MMR deficiency may be a resistance mechanism to temozolomide treatment for glioma, displaying lack of T cell infiltration and increased tumor mutational burden (Touat et al., 2020; 32322066, Mizoguchi et al., 2013; 23530875, Caccese et al., 2020; 32937743). Patients with MMR-deficient and hypermutated glioma showed worse treatment outcomes to immune checkpoint inhibitors (Touat et al., 2020; 3232206, Lombardi et al., 2020; 32823925).</Interpretation>

              <Interpretation>Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT, or hTERT) is a catalytic subunit of the telomerase complex, which is required to maintain appropriate chromosomal length (Shay et al., 2011; 22015685). Activation of TERT is a hallmark of cancer, being detected in up to 80-90% of malignancies and absent in quiescent cells (Shay et al., 1997; 9282118, Kim et al., 1994; 7605428, Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000; 10647931). Mutations within the promoter region of TERT that confer enhanced TERT promoter activity have been reported in two hotspots, located at -124 bp and -146 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site (also termed C228T and C250T, respectively)(Horn et al., 2013; 23348503, Huang et al., 2014; 23348506, Vinagre et al., 2013; 23887589), as well as tandem mutations at positions –124/–125 bp and –138/–139 bp (Horn et al., 2013; 23348503). TERT promoter mutations have been reported in 51-59% of gliomas (Killela et al., 2013; 23530248, Killela et al., 2014; 24722048), most frequently in glioblastoma (GBM, 54-84%), gliosarcoma (81%), oligodendroglioma (78%), and historically in oligoastrocytomas (25-31%) but less frequently in lower grade astrocytomas (10-18%) and in only 1% of ependymomas (Nonoguchi et al., 2013; 23955565, Liu et al., 2013; 23603989, Koelsche et al., 2013; 24154961, Killela et al., 2013; 23530248, Killela et al., 2014; 24722048). In patients with glioblastoma (GBM), the prevalence of TERT promoter mutation is lower in pediatric primary GBM (11%) and adult secondary GBM (28%) compared with adult primary GBM (58-83%) (Nonoguchi et al., 2013; 23955565, Killela et al., 2013; 23530248). One study detected TERT promoter mutations in 78% (181/232) of IDH-wildtype GBM samples analyzed (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). TERT promoter mutation has been shown to be significantly associated with increased TERT gene expression in astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, and GBM (Arita et al., 2013; 23764841). TERT promoter mutations significantly associate with poor prognosis in patients with GBM, although this correlation may be due to the association with primary GBM as opposed to IDH-positive secondary GBM (Killela et al., 2013; 23530248, Nonoguchi et al., 2013; 23955565, Reitman et al., 2013; 24217890, Arita et al., 2013; 23764841). In the context of IDH-wildtype glioma, TERT mutations are associated with reduced OS (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v2.2022). Therapeutic options for targeting tumors with TERT mutations are limited, although a variety of approaches have been investigated, including immunotherapies using TERT as a tumor-associated antigen and antisense oligonucleotide- or peptide-based therapies. TERT peptide vaccines showed limited anticancer efficacy in clinical trials (Zanetti et al., 2017; 27245281); however, in one preclinical study, the combination of a TERT peptide vaccine and anti-CTLA-4 therapy suppressed tumor growth (Duperret at al., 2018; 29249395). A Phase 2 study of the TERT inhibitor imetelstat for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer reported no improvement in PFS or OS (Chiappori et al., 2015; 25467017). TERT mutations are associated with 1p/19q co-deletion in oligodendrogliomas, and are highly recurrent in IDH/ATRX-wildtype glioblastoma (GBM) (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v1.2023)(Weller et al., 2020; 33293629). The presence of EGFR gene amplification or TERT promoter mutations are indicative of diffuse astrocytic glioma with molecular features of glioblastoma, WHO grade 4 in IDH1/2-wildtype tumors (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v2.2022) (Louis et al., 2021; 34185076).</Interpretation>

              <Interpretation>Functional loss of the tumor suppressor p53, which is encoded by the TP53 gene, is common in aggressive advanced cancers (Brown et al., 2009; 19935675). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TP53 function or expression (Joerger and Fersht, 2008; 18410249, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130, Zerdoumi et al., 2017; 28472496, Yamada et al., 2007; 17690113). In the TCGA dataset, TP53 alterations have been reported in 35% of glioblastomas (GBMs), with a high incidence in pediatric and secondary GBMs and a low incidence in primary GBMs (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2008; 18772890, Jha et al., 2011; 22089350). One study detected TP53 alterations in 31% (73/232) of IDH-wildtype GBM samples analyzed, with most of the events being mutations (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). TP53 mutations have been reported in 18-40% of astrocytoma samples, and preferentially in anaplastic astrocytoma; one study reported TP53 loss of function and partially/fully functional mutations in 15% and 25% of anaplastic astrocytomas, respectively (Uno et al., 2005; 15914282, Uno et al., 2006; 16711514, Lass et al., 2012; 22844452, Faria et al., 2012; 23009112, Milinkovic et al., 2013; 24358143, Galatro et al., 2013; 23613880). Some studies suggest that the presence of a TP53 mutation is correlated with a favorable prognosis in patients with glioblastoma (GBM) (Schmidt et al., 2002; 11939587). One study reported that TP53 alterations were associated with poorer OS (12.9 months altered vs. 19.7 months wildtype, HR=1.58, p=0.0054) in IDH-wildtype GBM (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). Mutation of TP53 is thought to be an early step in the tumorigenesis of astrocytomas, which can progress into anaplastic astrocytoma and then glioblastoma through gain of other genetic abnormalities such as loss of CDKN2A or RB1, followed by loss of PTEN (Nozaki et al., 1999; 11550308). Clinical and preclinical data suggest that solid tumors with TP53 mutations, such as R175H, Y220C, G245S, and R248W, may benefit from adoptive cell therapy targeting these specific TP53 mutations (Kim et al., 2022; 35749374, Zacharakis et al 2022; 35104158, Morelli et al., 2023; ASCO Abstract 2547). Clinical benefit has been reported for patients with breast cancer (2 PRs) (Kim et al., 2022; 35749374, Zacharakis et al 2022; 35104158), ovarian cancer (1 PR) (Kim et al., 2022; 35749374), and colorectal cancer (CRC; 1 SD) (Morelli et al., 2023; ASCO Abstract 2547) treated with tumor infiltrating lymphocyte-based or modified T-cell receptor-based adoptive cell therapy. There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633) or p53 gene therapy such as SGT53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628, Leung et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 4139). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% and SDs in 53% of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wildtype (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). Phase 2 studies of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy reported ORRs of 32% (30/94) and 41% (12/29) for patients with platinum-refractory TP53-mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513, Embaby et al., 2023; 37236033). For patients with platinum-sensitive TP53-mutated ovarian cancer, the combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (9.9 vs. 8.0 months) (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53-mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4-C trial for patients with TP53- and RAS-mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT-53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as eprenetapopt. In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53-positive high-grade serous ovarian cancer, eprenetapopt combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). A Phase 1 trial of eprenetapopt with pembrolizumab for patients with solid tumors reported an ORR of 10% (3/29) (Park et al., 2022; 36084396). One or more of the TP53 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (ClinVar, Sep 2023)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow-up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li-Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age-related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna-Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient-matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.</Interpretation>

              <Interpretation>Functional loss of the tumor suppressor p53, which is encoded by the TP53 gene, is common in aggressive advanced cancers (Brown et al., 2009; 19935675). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TP53 function or expression (Joerger and Fersht, 2008; 18410249, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130, Zerdoumi et al., 2017; 28472496, Yamada et al., 2007; 17690113).

              <Interpretation>Tumor mutational burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein-coding base substitutions and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen. TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide-based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB below levels that would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD-1- or PD-L1-targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Touat et al., 2020; 32322066, Kamiya-Matsuoka et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 393O, Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570, Johanns et al., 2016; 27683556, Lukas et al., 2018; 30073642). Glioblastoma (GBM) harbors a median TMB of 2.7 Muts/Mb, and 4.2% of cases have high TMB (&gt;20 Muts/Mb) (FMI-Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). For pediatric patients, high TMB has been reported in a subset of high-grade gliomas, frequently in association with mutations in MMR or proofreading genes and in TP53, whereas BRAF alterations or other oncogene fusions were observed more frequently in brain tumors harboring low TMB (Patel et al., 2020; 32386112, Johnson et al., 2017; 28912153). Increased TMB has been reported to correlate with higher tumor grade in glioma (Draaisma et al., 2015; 26699864) and glioblastoma (GBM) tissue samples with germline biallelic MMR deficiency (Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570) and with shorter OS for patients with diffuse glioma (Wang et al., 2020; 32164609). Increased TMB has also been associated with acquired MMR deficiency following temozolomide treatment for glioma, and patients with MMR-deficient glioma showed poor survival outcomes (Touat et al., 2020; 32322066, Lombardi et al., 2020; 32823925). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti-PD-L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti-PD-1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In glioma, a lack of association between TMB and clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors has been reported (Kamiya-Matsuoka et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 393O, Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Touat et al., 2020; 32322066). However, multiple case studies have reported that patients with ultramutated gliomas driven by POLE mutations have benefited from treatment with anti-PD-1 (Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570, Johanns et al., 2016; 27683556) or anti-PD-L1 (Lukas et al., 2018; 30073642) therapies. Therefore, although increased TMB alone may not be a strong biomarker for PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors in this cancer type, these agents may have efficacy for patients with glioma harboring both high TMB and POLE mutation.</Interpretation>
