CDKN2A/B p16INK4a loss and p14ARF loss exons 2-3
2 Disease relevant genes with no reportable alterations: KIT, NRAS

Diagnosis: Skin melanoma
MP No.:
Sample Type: Lymph Node, Slide Deck
Block Number: S112-23173 A (PF23073)
Tumor Percentage: 50%
NGS QC parameters: The median exon coverage for this sample is 760x

Analytic Interpretation: substitutions, insertion and deletion alterations (indels), and copy number alterations(CNAs) 
in 324 genes and select gene rearrangements, as well as genomic signatures including microsatellite instability (MSI), tumor
mutational burden(TMB) 

Analytical sensitivity : >99% of exons at coverage >100X

Methodology: Illumina HiSeq platform

Procedure: employ a single DNA extraction method from routine FFPE biopsy or surgical resection specimens, 50-1000 ng of which 
will undergo whole-genome shotgun library construction and hybridization-based capture of all coding exons from 309 cancer-related genes
, one promoter region, one non-coding (ncRNA), and select intronic regions from 34 commonly rearranged genes
, 21 of which also include the coding exons. The assay therefore includes detection of alterations in a total of 324 genes.
Using an Illumina HiSeq platform, hybrid capture¡Vselected libraries will be sequenced to high uniform depth 
(targeting >500X median coverage with >99% of exons at coverage >100X). Sequence data will be processed using a customized 
analysis pipeline designed to accurately detect all classes of genomic alterations, including base substitutions, indels
, focal copy number amplifications, homozygous gene deletions, and selected genomic rearrangements (e.g.,gene fusions). 
Additionally, genomic signatures including loss of heterozygosity (LOH), microsatellite instability (MSI) 
and tumor mutational burden (TMB) will be reported.
