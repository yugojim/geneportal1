Diagnosis: Soft tissue sarcoma (NOS)
MP No.:
Sample Type: Bone, Slide Deck
Block Number: S112-20200A (PF23085)
Tumor Percentage: 50%
NGS QC parameters: The median exon coverage for this sample is 678x

Analytic Interpretation: substitutions, insertion and deletion alterations (indels), and copy number alterations(CNAs) 
in 406 genes through DNA sequencing to interrogate 406 genes, as well as selected introns of 31 genes involved in rearrangements
, in addition to RNA sequencing of 265 genes. Also, genomic signatures including microsatellite instability (MSI)
, tumor mutational burden(TMB)

Analytical sensitivity : Samples with median exon coverage in the range 150 to 250 are considered qualified
, whereas those with coverage <150 are considered failed. For base substitutions, the mutant allele frequency (MAF) 
cutoff is 1% for known somatic variants (based on COSMIC v62) and 5% for novel somatic variants. For indels, the MAF cutoff is 3% for known 
somatic variants and 10% for novel somatic variants.

Methodology: Illumina HiSeq platform

Procedure:
1. DNA and RNA extraction: DNA and RNA are extracted from FFPE or fresh blood and/or bone marrow aspirate samples. 
2. cDNA synthesis: Samples are quantified for RNA yield using RiboGreen (LifeTech). Samples with RNA yield 3.5ng/L proceed to cDNA synthesis. 
3. Library construction and hybrid selection. All extracted DNA and cDNA are fragmented before library construction. 
50-200ng of DNA and the entire cDNA product are sheared by sonication to ~200bp fragment size. 
4. Using an Illumina HiSeq platform, hybrid capture-selected libraries will be sequenced to high uniform depth 
Sequence data will be processed using a customized analysis pipeline designed to accurately detect all classes of genomic alterations
, including base substitutions, indels, focal copy number amplifications, homozygous gene deletions, and selected genomic rearrangements
 (e.g.,gene fusions). Additionally, genomic signatures including microsatellite instability (MSI) and tumor mutational burden (TMB) 
will be reported.
