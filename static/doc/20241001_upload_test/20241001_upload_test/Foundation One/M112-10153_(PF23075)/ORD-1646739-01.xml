              <Interpretation>Blood tumor mutational burden (bTMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein-coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations from circulating tumor DNA in blood. TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide-based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a bTMB level that may be associated with sensitivity to PD-1- or PD-L1-targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). Average bTMB levels in solid tumors other than NSCLC have not been evaluated (PubMed, Mar 2023). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of TMB have mainly been investigated in the context of tissue TMB. In patients with NSCLC, increased TMB is associated with higher tumor grade and poor prognosis (Xiao et al., 2016; 27009843), as well as with a decreased frequency of known driver mutations in EGFR, ALK, ROS1, or MET (1% of high-TMB samples each), but not BRAF (10.3%) or KRAS (9.4%) (Spigel et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9017). Although some studies have reported a lack of association between smoking and increased TMB in NSCLC (Schwartz et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 8533, Xiao et al., 2016; 27009843, Shim et al., 2015; 26200269), several other large studies did find a strong link (Govindan et al., 2012; 22980976, Ding et al., 2008; 18948947, Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975, Kim et al., 2014; 24323028). In CRC, elevated TMB is associated with a higher frequency of BRAF V600E driver mutations (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117) and with microsatellite instability (MSI) (George et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3587, Nagahashi et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract e15103, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117), which in turn has been reported to correlate with better prognosis (Samowitz et al., 2001; 11535541, Elsaleh and Iacopetta, 2001; 12445368, Brueckl et al., 2003; 12820457, Guidoboni et al., 2001; 11438476, Gryfe et al., 2000; 10631274, Sinicrope et al., 2006; 16952542, Guastadisegni et al., 2010; 20627535, Laghi and Malesci, 2012; 22722556). Although increased TMB is associated with increased tumor grade in endometrioid endometrial carcinoma (Mehnert et al., 2016; 27159395, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2013; 23636398, Hussein et al., 2015; 25394778, Church et al., 2013; 23528559) and bladder cancer (Cazier et al., 2016; 24777035), it is also linked with improved prognosis in patients with these tumor types (Rosenberg et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 104, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2013; 23636398). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased blood tumor mutational burden (bTMB) may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti-PD-L1 (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511, Saori et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 80P, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716), anti-PD-1 (Schenker et al., 2022; AACR Abstract CT022, Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Peters et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT074, Saori et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 80P, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716), anti-PD-1/CTLA4 therapies (Schenker et al., 2022; AACR Abstract CT022, Saori et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 80P), anti-PD-L1/CTLA4 therapies (Chen et al., 2020; 32379280, Loree et al., 2021; ASCO GI Abstract 61, Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511, Rizvi et al., 2020; 32271377, Si et al., 2021; 33355200, Leighl et al., 2022; 34800700). A Phase 2 multi-solid-tumor trial showed that bTMB ≥16 Muts/Mb (as measured by this assay) was associated with improved survival from treatment with a PD-1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA-4 inhibitor (Schenker et al., 2022; AACR Abstract CT022). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), multiple clinical trials have shown patients with higher bTMB derive clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors following single-agent or combination treatments with either CTLA4 inhibitors or chemotherapy, with reported high bTMB cutpoints ranging from 6 Muts/Mb-16 Muts/Mb (Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Aggarwal et al. 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2020; 32271377, Si et al., 2021; 33355200, Leighl et al., 2022; 34800700). In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), a Phase 3 trial showed that bTMB ≥16 Muts/Mb (approximate equivalency ≥8 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) was associated with improved survival from treatment with a PD-L1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA-4 inhibitor (Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511). In colorectal cancer (CRC), a Phase 2 study showed that bTMB TMB ≥28 Muts/Mb (approximate equivalency ≥14 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) was associated with improved OS from a PD-L1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA-4 inhibitor (Loree et al., 2021; ASCO GI Abstract 61, Chen et al., 2020; 32379280).</Interpretation>

              <Interpretation>MET encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase, also known as c-MET or hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR), that is activated by the ligand HGF; MET activation results in signaling mediated partly by the RAS-RAF-MAPK and PI3K pathways to promote proliferation (Appleman, 2011; 22042966, Jung et al., 2012; 22553051). MET has been reported to be amplified in cancer (Gao et al., 2013; 23550210), with amplification positively correlating with protein expression in some cancer types (Ang et al., 2013; 23898085, Abou-Bakr and Elbasmi, 2013; 23996864, Ho et al., 2013; 24258573, Dziadziuszko et al., 2012; 22237262, Madoz-Gúrpide et al., 2015; 26319934) and associating with therapeutic response to MET inhibitors in a variety of cancer types (Kwak et al., 2015; ASCO GI Abstract 01, Ou et al., 2011; 21623265, Schwab et al., 2014; 24192513, Lennerz et al., 2011; 22042947, Chi et al., 2012; 22162573, Palma et al., 2014; 25232318, Le et al., 2015; 25922291, Ali et al., 2015; 25882375, Kwak et al., 2015; 26432108). In the TCGA datasets, amplification of MET has been found in several tumor types, with the highest incidences in esophageal carcinoma (3.3%), ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (3.2%), stomach adenocarcinoma (3.0%), and lung adenocarcinoma (2.2%) datasets; lower incidences were observed in various other tumor types (cBioPortal, Oct 2022)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). Overexpression of MET mRNA and protein has been observed in a number of cancers (Ang et al., 2013; 23898085, Abou-Bakr and Elbasmi, 2013; 23996864, Ho et al., 2013; 24258573). MET amplification has been associated with poor prognosis in gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma, gastric and esophageal cancer (Miller et al., 2006; 16186806, Tuynman et al., 2008; 18349821, Anderson et al., 2006; 17062664, Lennerz et al., 2011; 22042947, Graziano et al., 2011; 22042954, Lee et al., 2011; 21424128, Lee et al., 2012; 22644302). Increased MET expression has been associated with poor prognosis in cutaneous malignant melanoma (Cruz et al., 2003; 12837985), gallbladder adenocarcinoma (Yang et al., 2012; 22172411), lung large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (Rossi et al., 2005; 16314638), and breast cancer (Camp et al., 1999; 10590366, Lengyel et al., 2005; 15455388, Ghoussoub et al., 1998; 9554529). The prognostic value of MET amplification or expression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Yang et al., 2013; 23079155, Dziadziuszko et al., 2012; 22237262, Cappuzzo et al., 2009; 19255323, Park et al., 2012; 22207554, Chen et al., 2011; 22052229, Kanteti et al., 2009; 19817696, To et al., 2002; 11795945, Tsuta et al., 2012; 22198430), endometrial carcinoma (Felix et al., 2012; 22617129, Wagatsuma et al., 1998; 9452270, Bishop et al., 2011; 21168200, Felix et al., 2010; 20527227) or colon cancer (Garouniatis et al., 2013; 22733437, Liu et al., 2012; 22495710, Resnick et al., 2004; 15131045) have yielded conflicting results, although concurrent MET amplification and EGFR mutation have been correlated with reduced disease-free survival in NSCLC (Tanaka et al., 2012; 21733594). On the basis of extensive clinical evidence, MET amplification or activating mutations may predict sensitivity to MET-targeting therapies such as kinase inhibitors crizotinib, capmatinib, tepotinib, and cabozantinib. Crizotinib has benefited patients with MET-amplified non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) of varied histologies (Vassal et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 2595, Li et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 8090, Ou et al., 2011; 21623265, Schwab et al., 2014; 24192513, Le et al., 2015; 25922291, Schrock et al., 2017; 28315738), gastroesophageal cancer (Lennerz et al., 2011; 22042947), glioblastoma (Chi et al., 2012; 22162573), and carcinoma of unknown primary (Palma et al., 2014; 25232318). Capmatinib has demonstrated clinical efficacy for patients with MET-amplified cholangiocarcinoma (Lefler et al., 2022; 35129063), as well as MET-amplified NSCLC, both as a monotherapy (Schuler et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9067, Wu et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract P1.01-97, Wolf et al., 2020; 32877583) and in combination with an EGFR TKI for patients with concurrent activating EGFR mutations (Wu et al., 2018; 30156984, Gainor et al., 2020; 31864558, Gautschi et al., 2020; 31864554). Tepotinib has demonstrated efficacy for patients with MET-amplified hepatocellular carcinoma (Faivre et al., 2021; ASCO GI Abstract 329) and NSCLC (Le et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 9021) as a monotherapy as well as in combination with gefitinib for patients with MET-amplified and EGFR-mutated NSCLC (Liam et al., 2023; 36971777). Savolitinib elicited responses for patients with MET-amplified gastric cancer either alone or in combination with docetaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834, Kim et al., 2019; 30695737). AMG 337 elicited an ORR of 50% (5/10), including 1 CR, for patients with MET-amplified gastric, esophageal, or gastroesophageal junction cancer (Kwak et al., 2015; ASCO GI Abstract 01). Patients with MET-amplified NSCLC (Spigel et al., 2013; 24101053) or MET-amplified gastric cancer (Catenacci et al., 2011; 22389872) treated with the MET-targeting antibody onartuzumab (MetMAb) achieved clinical responses. In addition, high MET expression has been suggested to predict patient response to therapies such as the monoclonal HGF-targeting antibody rilotumumab as well as the combination of ramucirumab and the monoclonal MET-targeting antibody emibetuzumab (Oliner et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract 4005, Harding et al., 2019; 31142504). The Phase 2 LUMINOSITY study of the MET antibody drug conjugate telisotuzumab vedotin (teliso-V) reported a 37% (19/52) ORR for patients with non-squamous EGFR-wildtype tumors; lower ORRs were observed for patients with squamous (11%, 3/27) or non-squamous EGFR-mutated (12%, 5/43) tumors (Camidge et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT179). A Phase 1 study showed that teliso-V plus osimertinib yielded an ORR of 56% (10/18) for patients with EGFR-mutated MET-overexpressing NSCLC who progressed on osimertinib, including ORRs of 56% (5/9) for patients with an EGFR L858R mutation and 67% (6/9) for those with an EGFR exon 19 deletion (Goldman et al., 2022; ASCO Abstract 9013).</Interpretation>

                  <Rationale>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Approved Indications:&lt;/b&gt; Cabozantinib inhibits multiple tyrosine kinases, including MET, RET, VEGFRs, and ROS1. It is FDA approved as monotherapy to treat patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), and differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). It is also approved in combination with nivolumab to treat RCC. Please see the drug label for full prescribing information. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gene Association:&lt;/b&gt; Sensitivity of MET alterations to cabozantinib is suggested by clinical responses in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring MET mutations associated with MET exon 14 skipping, with or without concurrent MET amplification (Paik et al., 2015; 25971939, Klempner et al., 2016; 27693535), as well as by extensive preclinical data (Yakes et al., 2011; 21926191, Weber et al., 2014; 25260782, Navis et al., 2013; 23484006, Yeh et al., 2015; 26013381, Lee et al., 2014; 25534569, Torres et al., 2011; 21540237, Sameni et al., 2015; 26432786). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supporting Data:&lt;/b&gt; A randomized Phase 2 discontinuation study of cabozantinib in 9 solid tumor types reported ORRs of 0% to 22% and response durations of 3.3 to 11.2 months across cohorts with ORRs of 10% or greater observed for patients with ovarian cancer (22% [15/69, 1 CR]), metastatic breast cancer (14% [6/44]), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (10% [6/60]) (Schöffski et al., 2017; 29059635, Hellerstedt et al., 2019; 30528315). A Phase 1 study of cabozantinib for advanced solid tumors reported a 17% (4/23) ORR in the dose escalation cohort and an ORR of 20% (4/20) and a DCR of 100% (20/20) in the expansion cohort for Japanese patients with NSCLC (Nokihara et al., 2019; 30718102). In the context of studies for specific solid tumors, the randomized Phase 3 EXAM study for patients with advanced medullary thyroid cancer reported an association of cabozantinib with improved PFS compared with placebo (11.2 vs. 4.0 months, HR=0.28) and a higher ORR (28% vs. 0%), with PFS improvement observed regardless of RET mutation status (Elisei et al., 2013; 24002501). The randomized Phase 3 CELESTIAL study for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) previously treated with sorafenib reported significantly longer OS (10.2 vs. 8.0 months, HR=0.76) and PFS (5.2 vs. 1.9 months, HR=0.44) as well as an increased ORR (3.8% vs. 0.4%) with cabozantinib when compared to placebo (Abou-Alfa et al., 2018; 29972759). The Phase 2 CABOSUN trial of first line cabozantinib versus sunitinib for patients with intermediate- or poor-risk advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma demonstrated significantly improved median PFS (8.2 vs. 5.6 months, HR=0.66), prolonged median OS (30.3 vs. 21.8 months), and higher ORR (33% [26/79] vs. 12% [9/78]) with cabozantinib compared with sunitinib (Choueiri et al., 2017; 28199818). The Phase 2 CABONE study of cabozantinib reported ORRs of 26% (10/39) for patients with advanced Ewing sarcoma and 12% (5/42) for patients with advanced osteosarcoma (Italiano et al., 2020; 32078813). &lt;/p&gt;</Rationale>

                  <Rationale>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Approved Indications:&lt;/b&gt; Crizotinib is an inhibitor of the kinases MET, ALK, ROS1, and RON. It is FDA approved to treat patients with ALK rearrangement- or ROS1 rearrangement-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), adult and pediatric patients with ALK-positive inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT), and pediatric and young adult patients with ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL).

Crizotinib has also benefited patients with NSCLC or histiocytic sarcoma tumors harboring various alterations associated with MET exon 14 skipping (Awad et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 8511, Frampton et al., 2015; 25971938, Paik et al., 2015; 25971939, Waqar et al., 2015; 25898962, Mendenhall and Goldman, 2015; 25898965, Jenkins et al., 2015; 25769807). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supporting Data:&lt;/b&gt; Crizotinib has demonstrated efficacy for patients with NSCLC and ALK rearrangements (Shaw et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9066, Lu et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9058, Yoshida et al., 2016; 27354483, Solomon et al., 2014; 25470694, Shaw et al., 2013; 23724913), ROS1 rearrangements (Moro-Sibilot et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 8065, Goto et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9022, Shaw et al., 2014; 25264305, Mazieres et al., 2015; 25667280, Scheffler et al., 2015; 25868855), an NTRK1 fusion (Vaishnavi et al., 2013; 24162815), or MET activation (Drilon et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 108, Vassal et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 2595, Camidge et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 8001, Li et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 8090, Schrock et al., 2016; 27343443, Jorge et al., 2015; 26791794, Paik et al., 2015; 25971939, Mahjoubi et al., 2016; 26892698, Benderra et al., 2016; 26845121, Waqar et al., 2015; 25898962, Mendenhall and Goldman, 2015; 25898965, Jenkins et al., 2015; 25769807, Awad et al., 2016; 26729443, Jorge et al., 2015; 26791794, Schwab et al., 2014; 24192513, Zhang et al., 2016; 26724472, Ou et al., 2011; 21623265, Le et al., 2015; 25922291). Crizotinib has also benefited patients with MET-mutated renal cell carcinoma (Diamond et al., 2013; 23610116) and patients with MET-amplified gastroesophageal cancer, glioblastoma, and carcinoma of unknown primary (Lennerz et al., 2011; 22042947, Shi et al., 2012; 22162573, Palma et al., 2014; 25232318). While a Phase 1b study evaluating crizotinib to treat patients with ALK-positive malignancies, reported ORR of 52.9% (9/17) and 66.7% (6/9) for patients with lymphoma and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMT), respectively, an ORR of 11.8% (2/17) was reported for patients with other types of tumors (Gambacorti-Passerini et al., 2017; ASH Abstract 4128). Whereas median PFS and median OS were not reached for patients with lymphoma or IMT, median PFS was 1.3 months and median OS was 8.3 months for patients with other tumor types, and the median duration of treatment was ~1 month relative to 1-3 years for patients with lymphoma or IMT (Gambacorti-Passerini et al., 2017; ASH Abstract 4128). A Phase 1 clinical trial of crizotinib in pediatric solid tumors reported objective responses in 14/79 patients, including nine CRs and five PRs; response was enriched for patients with activating alterations in ALK (Mossé et al., 2013; 23598171). &lt;/p&gt;</Rationale>

Tepotinib has also been shown to be efficacious in combination with gefitinib for patients with concurrent EGFR mutation and MET amplification or MET overexpression in Phase 2 studies (Wu et al., 2019; IASLC Abstract MA09.09, Park et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 477O). In advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, Phase 2 studies of tepotinib reported improved ORR and PFS for both treatment-naive and previously treated patients with MET protein overexpression (Ryoo et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract 186P, Ryoo et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract 621PD, Decaens et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 698P, Faivre et al., 2021; ASCO GI Abstract 329). In a Phase 1 study of advanced solid tumors, tepotinib monotherapy yielded an ORR of 1.3% and a DCR of 24%, with 2 confirmed PRs observed for patients with esophageal or lung cancer and 2 unconfirmed PRs for patients with colorectal or nasopharyngeal cancer (Falchook et al., 2020; 31822497). In another Phase 1 study of solid tumors, tepotinib yielded a DCR of 17% (2/12), with 2 SD of ≥12 weeks observed in a patient with gastric cancer and another with urachal cancer (Shitara et al., 2020; 32328660). &lt;/p&gt;</Rationale>

              <Interpretation>MYC (c-MYC) encodes a transcription factor that regulates many genes related to cell cycle regulation and cell growth. It is an oncogene and may be activated in as many as 20% of cancers (Dang et al., 2006; 16904903). MYC dysregulation (amplification, overexpression, translocation) has been identified in a number of different cancer types (Nesbit et al., 1999; 10378696). MYC amplification has been significantly linked with increased mRNA and protein levels and results in the dysregulation of a large number of target genes (Blancato et al., 2004; 15083194, Dang et al., 2006; 16904903, Fromont et al., 2013; 23574779). MYC amplification has been reported in various solid tumors including breast (9.6%), ovarian (6.7%), melanoma (5.8%), endometrial (5.5%), non-small cell lung (5.5%), prostate (4.7%), esophagogastric (4.4%), and colorectal (3.9%) cancer (cBio-Zehir et al., 2017; 28481359). In patients with some tumor types, such as lung cancer, MYC amplification has been associated with improved relapse-free survival, whereas in patients with other cancer types, such as prostate cancer, MYC overexpression has been associated with cancer recurrence (Iwakawa et al., 2011; 21148746, Hawksworth et al., 2010; 20820186, Goga et al., 2007; 17589519, Molenaar et al., 2009; 19525400, Yang et al., 2010; 20643922). Limited clinical data indicates that MYC activation may predict sensitivity to the pan-MYC inhibitor OMO-103; a Phase 1 study for patients with solid tumors reported 7 SDs (n=18), including 8% tumor reduction in a patient with pancreas adenocarcinoma (Garralda et al., 2022; ENA Abstract 7). Preclinical data indicate MYC overexpression may predict sensitivity to investigational agents targeting CDK1 (Horiuchi et al., 2012; 22430491, Goga et al., 2007; 17589519), CDK2 (Molenaar et al., 2009; 19525400), Aurora kinase A (Dammert et al., 2019; 31375684, Mollaoglu et al., 2017; 28089889, Robert et al., 2017; 29088717, Wang et al., 2017; 28417568, Takahashi et al., 2015; 25632068, Li et al., 2018; 30226440, Kong et al., 2017; DOI: 10.21037/tcr.2017.06.41, Mahadeva et al., 2014; 24893165, Park et al., 2019; 31429028), Aurora kinase B (Helfrich et al., 2016; 27496133, Hook et al., 2012; 22222631, Yang et al., 2010; 20643922, He et al., 2019; 30540594), glutaminase (Shroff et al., 2015; 25964345, Effenberger et al., 2017; 29156762, Shen et al., 2018; 30103944, Xiang et al., 2015; 25915584), or BET bromodomain-containing proteins (Delmore et al., 2011; 21889194, Bandopadhayay et al., 2013; 24297863, Loven et al., 2013; 23582323, Otto et al., 2019; 31734632), as well as agents targeting both HDAC and PI3K (Dong et al., 2013; 23866964, Pei et al., 2016; 26977882; Fu et al., 2019; 30224636). Exploratory biomarker analysis in a Phase 2 study reported a PFS benefit associated with a combination of the Aurora A kinase inhibitor alisertib and paclitaxel as second-line therapy for patients with MYC-overexpressed small cell lung cancer, but not for patients without MYC overexpression (Owonikoko et al., 2020; 31655296). A PR was reported for a patient with MYC-amplified invasive ductal breast carcinoma treated with an unspecified Aurora kinase inhibitor and taxol (Ganesan et al., 2014; 25253784). MYC amplification has also been suggested to predict response to chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer in some studies (Pereira et al., 2013; 23555992, Yasojima et al., 2011; 21741827). Preclinical evidence suggests that colon cancer cells with MYC amplification may be more sensitive to 5-fluorouracil and paclitaxel (Arango et al., 2001; 11406570, Bottone et al., 2003; 14516787).</Interpretation>

              <Interpretation>CTCF encodes an 11-zinc-finger protein that is implicated in various regulatory roles, including gene activation and repression, imprinting, insulation, methylation, and X chromosome inactivation (Phillips and Corces, 2009; 19563753). CTCF plays a role in transcriptional regulation of a number of key cancer-associated genes, including the oncogene MYC (Gombert and Krumm, 2009; 19568426) and tumor suppressor TP53 (Soto-Reyes and Recillas-Targa, 2010; 20101205), via maintenance of local DNA methylation status. Decreased expression levels of CTCF and/or BORIS, another 11-zinc-finger transcriptional regulator, were reported to be closely associated with global DNA methylation variability and decreased OS in epithelial ovarian cancer (Woloszynska-Read et al., 2011; 21296871, Kemp et al., 2014; 24794443). Somatic mutations in CTCF are infrequently reported in most cancers, but have been observed more commonly (24%) in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (cBioPortal, 2023)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210); nearly half of the observed mutations were truncating, suggesting a tumor suppressor role for CTCF in this disease. In addition, CTCF has been found to act as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer cell line studies (Méndez-Catalá et al., 2013; 23908591, Tiffen et al., 2013; 23553099). There are no targeted therapies available to address genomic alterations in CTCF.</Interpretation>

              <Interpretation>Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). The level of MSI in this sample could not be determined with confidence. Depending on the clinical context, MSI testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. MSI-high (MSI-H) has been observed at high frequency in endometrial cancers (14-33%)(Santin et al., ASCO 2016; Abstract 414, Zighelboim et al., 2007; 17513808, Hampel et al., 2006; 16885385, Stelloo et al., 2016; 27006490, Kanopiene et al., 2014; 25458958, Black et al., 2006; 16549821, Nout et al., 2012; 22609107, Steinbakk et al., 2011; 21547578, Bilbao et al., 2010; 20005452), colorectal cancers (CRCs; 10-15%)(Guastadisegni et al., 2010; 20627535, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), and gastric cancers (12-35%)(Hiyama et al., 2004; 15209621, Wu et al., 1998; 9537253, dos Santos et al., 1996; 8536886, Fang et al., 2013; 23555086) and at lower frequencies in many other tumor types, including esophageal (Hall et al., 2016; ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancer Symposium Abstract 528, Farris et al., 2011; 21422910), small bowel (Gingras et al., 2015; AACR Pancreatic Cancer Abstract PR06, Agaramet al., 2010; 20395525, Ruemmele et al., 2009; 19252434, Planck et al., 2003; 12627520, Hibi et al., 1995; 7775257, Muneyuki et al., 2000; 11117578), hepatobiliary (Zhang et al., 2005; 15918185, Chiappini et al., 2004; 14656944, Suto et al., 2001; 11223838, Momoi et al., 2001; 11580146, Liengswangwong et al., 2003; 14506736, Moy et al., 2015; 25680569, Yoshida et al., 2000; 11063221), prostate (Cheng et al., 2016; Genitourinary Cancers Symposium Abstract 251, Pritchard et al., 2014; 25255306, Azzouzi et al., 2007; 17233803, Burger et al., 2006; 16924473), and urinary tract carcinomas (Harper et al., 2015; USCAP Abstract 905, Bai et al., 2013; 23690119, Giedl et al., 2014; 25319978, Yamamoto et al., 2006; 16675567). In one study, MSI-H status was associated with a positive prognostic effect in patients with gastric cancer treated with surgery alone and a negative predictive effect in patients treated with chemotherapy (Smyth et al., 2015; ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium Abstract 62). Data regarding the role of MSI-H on prognosis and survival in endometrial cancer are conflicting (Zighelboim et al., 2007; 17513808, Kanopiene et al., 2014; 25458958, Bilbao-Sieyro et al., 2014; 25026289, Mackay et al., 2010; 20304627, Steinbakk et al., 2011; 21547578, Arabi et al., 2009; 19275958, Black et al., 2006; 16549821). However, studies specifically analyzing early stage endometrial cancer have reported a correlation between MSI-H and decreased survival (Stelloo et al., 2016; 27006490, Mackay et al., 2010; 20304627, Nout et al., 2012; 22609107, Bilbao et al., 2010; 20005452), thereby suggesting that MSI-H predicts for poor prognosis in this subset of endometrial tumors. On the basis of clinical evidence in multiple solid tumor types, microsatellite instability (MSI) and associated increased tumor mutational burden (TMB) (Jass, 2007; 17204026, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894) may predict sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors, including the approved PD-1-targeting agents cemiplimab, dostarlimab, nivolumab (alone or in combination with ipilimumab), retifanlimab, and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2017; 28734759, Overman et al., 2018; 29355075, Overman et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 635, Shitara et al., 2022; 35322232, Andre et al., 2022; ASCO GI Abstract 244, Lipson et al., 2013; 23169436, Le et al., 2015; 26028255, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070, Oaknin et al., 2020; 33001143, Berton et al., 2021; SITC Abstract 956), as well as PD-L1-targeting agents atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab (alone or in combination with tremelimumab) (Hochster et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 673, Fleming et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 5585, Bang et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 92, Pietrantonio et al., 2023; ASCO GI Abstract 358, Lee et al., 2023; ASCO GI abstract 401, Rubinstein et al., 2022; 36512912, Marie et al., 2021; 33811152). As the MSI status of this tumor is unknown, the relevance of these therapeutic approaches is unclear.</Interpretation>

              <Interpretation>Functional loss of the tumor suppressor p53, which is encoded by the TP53 gene, is common in aggressive advanced cancers (Brown et al., 2009; 19935675). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TP53 function or expression (Joerger and Fersht, 2008; 18410249, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130, Zerdoumi et al., 2017; 28472496, Yamada et al., 2007; 17690113). Pan-cancer analysis of the TCGA datasets across 12 cancer types identified TP53 as the most frequently mutated gene, with 42% of more than 3,000 tumors harboring a TP53 mutation; in this study TP53 mutation occurred most frequently in ovarian serous carcinoma (95%), lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (79%), head and neck SCC (70%), colorectal adenocarcinoma (59%), lung adenocarcinoma (52%), and bladder urothelial carcinoma (50%) (Kandoth et al., 2013; 24132290). TP53 loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is frequently seen in tumors and often occurs when one copy of TP53 harbors a mutation; in some tumors, LOH is correlated with progression (Wongsurawat et al., 2006; 16537709, Brosh and Rotter, 2009; 19693097, Baker et al., 1989; 2649981, Calcagno et al., 2013; 24053468). While the prognostic significance of TP53 alteration or dysregulation varies according to tumor type, studies have shown an association with poor prognosis for patients with breast cancer (Alsner et al., 2008; 18465328, Olivier et al., 2006; 16489069, Végran et al., 2013; 23359294), endometrial cancer (Wild et al., 2012; 22678923, Lee et al., 2010; 20006376), HNSCC (Ganci et al., 2013; 24107801, Lindenbergh-van et al., 2011; 21467160, Peltonen et al., 2011; 21513535), or urothelial cancer (Bringuier et al., 1998; 9761125, Feng et al., 2014; 24500328). In one study of 55 patients with lung adenocarcinoma, TP53 alterations correlated with immunogenic features including PD-L1 expression, tumor mutation burden and neoantigen presentation; likely as a consequence of this association TP53 mutations correlated with improved clinical outcomes to PD-1 inhibitors pembrolizumab and nivolumab in this study (Dong et al., 2016; 28039262). TP53 mutation has not been consistently demonstrated to be a significant independent prognostic marker in the context of CRC (Russo et al., 2005; 16172461, Fong et al., 2022; ASCO GI Abstract 57). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633) or p53 gene therapy such as SGT53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628, Leung et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 4139). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% and SDs in 53% of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wildtype (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 32% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum-refractory TP53-mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 43% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum-refractory TP53-mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53-mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53-mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4-C trial for patients with TP53- and RAS-mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT-53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as eprenetapopt. In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53-positive high-grade serous ovarian cancer, eprenetapopt combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). A Phase 1 trial of eprenetapopt with pembrolizumab for patients with solid tumors reported an ORR of 10% (3/29) (Park et al., 2022; 36084396). One or more of the TP53 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with hereditary cancer-predisposing syndrome (ClinVar, Apr 2023)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow-up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li-Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age-related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna-Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient-matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.</Interpretation>

              <Interpretation>Tumor fraction provides an estimate of the percentage of ctDNA present in a cell-free DNA (cfDNA) sample. The tumor fraction estimate for this sample is based on the observed level of aneuploid instability. The tumor fraction algorithm utilized for FoundationOne Liquid CDx uses the allele frequencies of approximately 1,000 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites across the genome. Unlike the maximum somatic allele frequency (MSAF) method of estimating ctDNA content (Li et al., 2019; 31602320), the tumor fraction metric does not take into account the allele frequency of individual variants but rather produces a more holistic estimate of ctDNA content using data from across the genome. The amount of ctDNA detected may correlate with disease burden and response to therapy (Zhang et al., 2020; 32757294, Butler et al., 2019; 30833418). Detectible ctDNA levels have been reported in a variety of tumor types, with higher tumor fraction levels reported for patients with metastatic (Stage 4) tumors compared with patients with localized disease (Stages 1 to 3) (Bettegowda et al., 2014; 24553385). Elevated tumor fraction levels have been reported to be associated with worse prognosis in a variety of cancer types, including pancreatic cancer (Lapin et al., 2018; 30400802), Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma (Shulman et al., 2018; 30131550), prostate cancer (Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO abstract 5039), breast cancer (Stover et al., 2018; 29298117), leiomyosarcoma (Hemming et al., 2019; 30793095), esophageal cancer (Egyud et al., 2019; 31059681), colorectal cancer (Fan et al., 2017; 28187169), and gastrointestinal cancer (Vu et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1200/PO.19.00204). Specimens with elevated tumor fraction have high circulating-tumor DNA (ctDNA) content, and thus higher sensitivity for identifying genomic alterations. Such specimens are at a lower risk of false negative results. Tumor fraction levels currently have limited implications for diagnosis, surveillance, or therapy and should not be overinterpreted or compared from one blood draw to another. There are currently no targeted approaches to address specific tumor fraction levels. In the research setting, changes in tumor fraction estimates have been associated with treatment duration and clinical response and may be a useful indicator for future cancer management (Bronkhorst et al., 2019; 30923679, Raja et al., 2018; 30093454, Hrebien et al., 2019; 30860573, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5039, Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Goodall et al., 2017; 28450425, Goldberg et al., 2018; 29330207).</Interpretation>

              <Interpretation>VEGFA (vascular endothelial growth factor A) encodes a ligand that promotes angiogenesis through the receptor tyrosine kinases VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 (Goel and Mercurio., 2013; 24263190). VEGFA promotes tumor growth by activating both autocrine VEGFR signaling in tumor cells and paracrine signaling to fibroblasts and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (Goel and Mercurio., 2013; 24263190). VEGFA has been reported to be amplified in cancer (Gao et al., 2013; 23550210), and is associated with response to sorafenib (Horwitz et al., 2014; 24687604). In the TCGA datasets, VEGFA amplification was observed in 13% of esophageal carcinoma, 7% of stomach adenocarcinoma, 3% of lung adenocarcinoma, 2% of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and 1% of colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC) cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079317, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552, Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696). Amplification of the 6p12 locus, where VEGFA is located, has been observed in 3% of CRC cases (Vlajnic et al., 2011; 21743435). Increased plasma VEGF-A levels have been associated with decreased overall survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Mok et al., 2014; 24807156, Hegde et al., 2013; 23169435) and with worse prognosis in patients with cervical cancer (Du et al., 2014; 25374209), and VEGF expression was reported to be correlated with higher stage in hypopharyngeal SCC (Hong et al., 2014; 25158264). There have been conflicting reports regarding the value of serum VEGF-A levels as a prognostic indicator in patients with gastric cancer (Van Cutsem et al., 2012; 22565005, Park do et al., 2014; 24370903), gastroesophageal junction cancer (Park do et al., 2014; 24370903), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Mok et al., 2014; 24807156, Hegde et al., 2013; 23169435), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (Chang et al., 2008; 18665074, Georgiadou et al., 2014; 24480377, Rahbari et al., 2011; 21729304); furthermore, it has not been shown that VEGFA amplification or expression in tumor cells results in increased plasma levels of VEGF-A (Mok et al., 2014; 24807156). The approved VEGFA-targeted agents bevacizumab and ziv-aflibercept have demonstrated efficacy in multiple tumor types; however, expression or amplification of VEGFA has not been established as a reliable biomarker of response to these therapies (Van Cutsem et al., 2012; 22565005, Miles et al., 2013; 23422754, Gianni et al., 2013; 23569311, Cameron et al., 2013; 23932548, Hegde et al., 2013; 23169435, Schneider et al., 2012; 23340303, Baumgarten et al., 2016; 26627848, Sathornsumetee et al., 2008; 18182667, Olafson et al., 2019; 31582283, Nishikawa et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 2023, Wick et al., 2013; WCN Abstract 1207, Duda et al., 2010; 20484123, Stremitzer et al., 2016; 27535973, Weickhardt et al., 2015; 26125443, Kopetz et al., 2009; 20008624, Fountzilas et al., 2011; 21868552, Sánchez-Rovira et al., 2013; 23397155, Mok et al., 2014; 24807156, An et al., 2014; 24577128, Bais et al., 2017; 29059426, Van Cutsem et al., 2011; EMCC Abstract 803, Xu et al., 2009; 19826039, Hasselbalch et al., 2010; 20666740, Marisi et al., 2017; 28465540, Jubb et al., 2005; 16365183, Goede et al., 2010; 20924372, Bruhn et al., 2013; 24374727, Escudier et al., 2007; 18156031, Yang et al., 2003; 12890841, Burstein et al., 2008; 19047116, Jubb et al., 2011; 21224365, Miles et al., 2017; 27817944, Dowlati et al., 2008; 18316562, Horn et al., 2009; 19826110, Blakeley et al., 2016; 26976425). Preclinical hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) models with VEGFA amplification showed increased sensitivity to sorafenib, and a small retrospective study reported significantly increased OS for 7 patients with VEGFA-amplified HCC treated with sorafenib (Horwitz et al., 2014; 24687604). However, a prospective biomarker study showed that VEGFA amplification detected by circulating cell-free DNA was not significantly associated with DCR, time to progression, or median OS for patients with HCC treated with first-line sorafenib (Oh et al., 2019; 30935424). It is currently not known if VEGFA amplification predicts response to other inhibitors targeting VEGFRs.</Interpretation>
